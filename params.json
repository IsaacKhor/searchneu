Before you start working with redux-minimal, you first need to setup your environment. Make sure you have the following installed:\r\n    * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\r\n    * [NodeJs and Npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)\r\n    * an IDE to write js code in, for example [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)\r\n\r\n2. Once your environment is prepared, open a command prompt (terminal) and type in the following:\r\n\r\n    ```sh\r\n    cd C:\\js\\node\\apps\r\n    git clone https://github.com/catalin-luntraru/redux-minimal.git hello-world\r\n    cd hello-world\r\n    npm install\r\n    npm start\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Then open your [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the included small users app. \r\nCongratulations! You can now write react redux code.\r\n\r\n4. For more productivity you can install Chrome's [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Why use this?\r\n\r\nRedux-Minimal contains the minimum npm packages you need to have installed in order to build a react redux real-world app containing:\r\n* a proper file/folder structure\r\n* pages (routes)\r\n* forms with validation\r\n* real-world API asynchronous requests\r\n* unit tests\r\n* bootstrap react components\r\n* sass\r\n* hot loader for ease of development\r\n* redux tools\r\n* js and css bundle files built for development or production\r\n\r\nThe code and implementation are minimal, which lets you focus on the real app, not the webpack, babel, gulp etc boilerplate files, which honestly you shouldn't even bother with.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installed packages\r\n\r\nHere are the npm packages that redux-minimal installs:\r\n\r\n|Feature|Packages|Benefits|\r\n|-------|--------|--------|\r\n|React|[`react`](https://github.com/facebook/react)|A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces|\r\n||[`react-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)|Serves as the entry point of the DOM-related rendering paths|\r\n||[`react-hot-loader`](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)|Tweak React components in real time when developing|\r\n|Redux|[`redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)|A predictable state container for JavaScript apps|\r\n||[`react-redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)|React bindings for Redux|\r\n|Router|[`react-router`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)|Declarative routing for React.
