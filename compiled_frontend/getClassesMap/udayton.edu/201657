These norms include many of the same values and commitments that are embraced by the treaties, conventions and covenants that comprise the international law of human rights (for example, the notion that every human being has inherent dignity and is inviolable). A commitment to these norms entails a further commitment to do what we reasonably can do to get certain rights against government established and protected as fundamental legal rights. Through an examination of scholarly literature, constitutional texts, court decisions and documents that ground international human rights, students will consider the implications of our constitutional morality for how we should think about the issues of capital punishment and same-sex marriage.
