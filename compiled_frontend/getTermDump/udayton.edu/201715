It will explore those ethical problems which can give rise to legal liability for the corporation, its managers, and its directors. Such liability can arise through private suits for breach of fiduciary duty, public and private suits for violation of Federal and State securities laws, or even criminal actions brought by Federal and State governments. Particular emphasis will be placed on the role of corporate counsel, litigation attorneys, and others similarly situated in handling the ethical problems that can result in civil or criminal liability.

These norms include many of the same values and commitments that are embraced by the treaties, conventions and covenants that comprise the international law of human rights (for example, the notion that every human being has inherent dignity and is inviolable). A commitment to these norms entails a further commitment to do what we reasonably can do to get certain rights against government established and protected as fundamental legal rights. Through an examination of scholarly literature, constitutional texts, court decisions and documents that ground international human rights, students will consider the implications of our constitutional morality for how we should think about the issues of capital punishment and same-sex marriage.
