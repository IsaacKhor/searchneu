This course introduces the architecture, structure, functions, components, and models of the Internet and other computer networks. It uses OSI and TCP layered models to examine the nature and roles of protocols and services at the the application, network, data link, and physical layers. The principles and structure of IP addressing and the fundamentals of Ethernet concepts, media, and operations are introduced to provide a foundation for the curriculum. Labs use a a \"model internet\" to allow students to analyze real data without affecting production networks. Packet Tracer (PT) activities help students analyze protocol and network operation and build small networks in a simulated environment.
