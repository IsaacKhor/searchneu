One of the best ways to do that is by creating your own ePortfolio. An ePortfolio is a site that showcases or shows your background, your resume, and samples of your work. In this course, you will learn step by step how to build the site and you’ll learn the grammar, vocabulary and writing skills needed to create it. You will learn how to apply information from your ePortfolio to other online tools like LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube in order to network with others so that you get a job or connect with other professionals. For each step in that process, you will listen to lectures, take comprehension quizzes, and learn how to use English appropriately to each part of your site. You will also complete self and peer assessments and gain the needed skills to make your ePortfolio a reality and establish yourself online. 0.000 Continuing Education Units 0.000 Lecture hours Syllabus Available","classId":"0003M","prettyUrl":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201721&subj_code_in=ESL&crse_numb_in=0003M","name":"Build Your Prof ePortfolio","maxCredits":0,"minCredits":0,"url":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201721&subj_in=ESL&crse_in=0003M&schd_in=%","host":"gatech.edu","termId":"201721","subject":"ESL","lastUpdateTime":1482866608759,"crns":[],"classUid":"0003M_847454767"},"gatech.edu/201721/ESL/4107L_1138810737":{"_id":"5862bfb1d1f17c1be803613e","desc":"See Course Description for Credit Course MATH 4107 (Oscar) 3.000 Continuing Education Units 30.000 Lecture hours Syllabus Available","classId":"4107L","prettyUrl":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201721&subj_code_in=ESL&crse_numb_in=4107L","name":"MATH 4107: Abst Algebra I (30)","maxCredits":3,"minCredits":3,"url":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201721&subj_in=ESL&crse_in=4107L&schd_in=%","host":"gatech.edu","termId":"201721","subject":"ESL","lastUpdateTime":1482866609019,"crns":[],"classUid":"4107L_1138810737"},"gatech.edu/201721/ESL/4280L_777328097":{"_id":"5862bfb1d1f17c1be8036148","desc":"See Course Description for Credit Course MATH 4280 (Oscar) 3.000 Continuing Education Units 30.000 Lecture hours Syllabus Available","classId":"4280L","prettyUrl":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201721&subj_code_in=ESL&crse_numb_in=4280L","name":"MATH 4280: Info Theory (30)","maxCredits":3,"minCredits":3,"url":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201721&subj_in=ESL&crse_in=4280L&schd_in=%","host":"gatech.edu","termId":"201721","subject":"ESL","lastUpdateTime":1482866609584,"crns":[],"classUid":"4280L_777328097"},"gatech.edu/201721/ESL/4755L_1467664098":{"_id":"5862bfb2d1f17c1be8036152","desc":"See Course Description for Credit Course MATH 4755 (Oscar) 3.000 Continuing Education Units 30.000 Lecture hours Syllabus Available","classId":"4755L","prettyUrl":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201721&subj_code_in=ESL&crse_numb_in=4755L","name":"MATH 4755: Math Biology (30)","maxCredits":3,"minCredits":3,"url":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201721&subj_in=ESL&crse_in=4755L&schd_in=%","host":"gatech.edu","termId":"201721","subject":"ESL","lastUpdateTime":1482866610137,"crns":[],"classUid":"4755L_1467664098"},"gatech.edu/201721/ESL/434PL_1420764536":{"_id":"5862bfb2d1f17c1be803615c","desc":"See Course Description for Credit Course PHYS 4347 (Oscar) 3.000 Continuing Education Units 30.000 Lecture hours Syllabus Available","classId":"434PL","prettyUrl":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201721&subj_code_in=ESL&crse_numb_in=434PL","name":"PHYS 4347: Fund Astrophys (30)","maxCredits":3,"minCredits":3,"url":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201721&subj_in=ESL&crse_in=434PL&schd_in=%","host":"gatech.edu","termId":"201721","subject":"ESL","lastUpdateTime":1482866610702,"crns":[],"classUid":"434PL_1420764536"},"gatech.edu/201721/ESL/6101L_1456276326":{"_id":"5862bfb2d1f17c1be8036160","desc":"See Course Description for Credit Course PHYS 6101 (Oscar) 3.000 Continuing Education Units 30.000 Lecture hours Syllabus Available","classId":"6101L","prettyUrl":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201721&subj_code_in=ESL&crse_numb_in=6101L","name":"PHYS 6101: Class Mech I (30)","maxCredits":3,"minCredits":3,"url":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201721&subj_in=ESL&crse_in=6101L&schd_in=%","host":"gatech.edu","termId":"201721","subject":"ESL","lastUpdateTime":1482866610995,"crns":[],"classUid":"6101L_1456276326"},"gatech.edu/201721/ESL/AA09L_1196907949":{"_id":"5862bfb3d1f17c1be8036163","desc":"Effective communication in any language is more than just using correct grammar and vocabulary.

US university courses require a great deal of reading. For example, teachers may ask you to read 30-60 pages for each class in addition to whatever reading you may need to do for independent research projects. For this reason, it is extremely important that you are able to read college level texts effectively and efficiently. This course is designed to help you improve your reading skills in preparation for the demands of US university classrooms. In this course, you will learn how to read and discuss college level texts, specifically textbook chapters and academic research articles. The ultimate goal of this course is to provide you with the knowledge, strategies, skills, and confidence necessary to read and discuss college level texts on familiar and unfamiliar topics. In addition to receiving instruction in reading strategies, you will receive instruction in note-taking and developing critical thinking skills.
