One of the best ways to do that is by creating your own ePortfolio. An ePortfolio is a site that showcases or shows your background, your resume, and samples of your work. In this course, you will learn step by step how to build the site and you’ll learn the grammar, vocabulary and writing skills needed to create it. You will learn how to apply information from your ePortfolio to other online tools like LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube in order to network with others so that you get a job or connect with other professionals. For each step in that process, you will listen to lectures, take comprehension quizzes, and learn how to use English appropriately to each part of your site. You will also complete self and peer assessments and gain the needed skills to make your ePortfolio a reality and establish yourself online. 0.000 Continuing Education Units 0.000 Lecture hours Syllabus Available","classId":"0003M","prettyUrl":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201626&subj_code_in=ESL&crse_numb_in=0003M","name":"Build Your Prof ePortfolio","maxCredits":0,"minCredits":0,"url":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201626&subj_in=ESL&crse_in=0003M&schd_in=%","host":"gatech.edu","termId":"201626","subject":"ESL","lastUpdateTime":1482866591159,"crns":[],"classUid":"0003M_847454767"},"gatech.edu/201626/ESL/3143L_1214040008":{"_id":"5862bf9fd1f17c1be803600b","desc":"See Course Descrption for Credit Course PHYS 3143 (Oscar) 3.000 Continuing Education Units 30.000 Lecture hours Syllabus Available","classId":"3143L","prettyUrl":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201626&subj_code_in=ESL&crse_numb_in=3143L","name":"PHYS 3143: Quantum Mech I (30)","maxCredits":3,"minCredits":3,"url":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201626&subj_in=ESL&crse_in=3143L&schd_in=%","host":"gatech.edu","termId":"201626","subject":"ESL","lastUpdateTime":1482866591433,"crns":[],"classUid":"3143L_1214040008"},"gatech.edu/201626/ESL/3123L_2105722489":{"_id":"5862bf9fd1f17c1be803600f","desc":"See Course Description for Credit Course PHYS 3123 (Oscar) 3.000 Continuing Education Units 30.000 Lecture hours Syllabus Available","classId":"3123L","prettyUrl":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201626&subj_code_in=ESL&crse_numb_in=3123L","name":"PHYS 3123: Electrodynmcs (30)","maxCredits":3,"minCredits":3,"url":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201626&subj_in=ESL&crse_in=3123L&schd_in=%","host":"gatech.edu","termId":"201626","subject":"ESL","lastUpdateTime":1482866591790,"crns":[],"classUid":"3123L_2105722489"},"gatech.edu/201626/ESL/4143L_1909535161":{"_id":"5862bfa0d1f17c1be8036018","desc":"See Course Description for Credit Course PHYS 4143 (Oscar) 3.000 Continuing Education Units 30.000 Lecture hours Syllabus Available","classId":"4143L","prettyUrl":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201626&subj_code_in=ESL&crse_numb_in=4143L","name":"PHYS 4143: Quantm Mech II (30)","maxCredits":3,"minCredits":3,"url":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201626&subj_in=ESL&crse_in=4143L&schd_in=%","host":"gatech.edu","termId":"201626","subject":"ESL","lastUpdateTime":1482866592248,"crns":[],"classUid":"4143L_1909535161"},"gatech.edu/201626/ESL/4142L_122865582":{"_id":"5862bfa0d1f17c1be8036022","desc":"See Course Description for Credit Coruse PHYS 4142 (Oscar) 3.000 Continuing Education Units 30.000 Lecture hours Syllabus Available","classId":"4142L","prettyUrl":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201626&subj_code_in=ESL&crse_numb_in=4142L","name":"PHYS 4142: Stat Mechanics (30)","maxCredits":3,"minCredits":3,"url":"https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201626&subj_in=ESL&crse_in=4142L&schd_in=%","host":"gatech.edu","termId":"201626","subject":"ESL","lastUpdateTime":1482866592817,"crns":[],"classUid":"4142L_122865582"},"gatech.edu/201626/ESL/0004M_2015849680":{"_id":"5862bf9fd1f17c1be8036005","desc":"This Capstone builds on the communication and content skills you’ve acquired throughout the Specialization and develops them further.
