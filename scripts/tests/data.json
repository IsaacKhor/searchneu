He takes off points for no reason what so ever.","Take psych stats with any other professor. He grades mostly on vocab that you have to go search the definitions for, and a lot of the time exact book definitions would be wrong. 23 of the exam werent even on math. I have no idea why he has a 4 for helpfulness because I went to office hours and he seemed confused that i was there.  Terrible class","He's burt out, doesnt care, doesnt teach in class but grades brutally. He's kind of funny but other then that he sucks. Maybe stats is fine but research design is the worst course ive taken at NU. I HATE the man becuase of how poorly he conducted the class. He stops teaching midway through the school year!!!","Horrible teacher!!!He makes easy things so complicated. He says examples instead of writing them for a MATH class. You cant follow the book because he teaches it a different way. Students would ask for help he would say &quot; what do you think&quot;, students would ask &quot; how do you put formulas in the calculator he would say &quot;figure it out&quot;. DO NOT TAKE HIM","This man is a horrible teacher. If you had taken STATS in highschool then you will probably get it, however I didnt , everyone complained about the call and how he taught. He is so scattered, that he becomes confusing ! the Final was really long took all of the two hours, DONT TAKE !!! if you need step by step process.","I LOVED him! I had him for Stats and he made it fun and easy. Used real life psych examples which helped to see its real world applications. Answers questions well and will discuss test results if you ask. TAKE HIM! Also an advisor so he is a good man to know. Laid back and easy going. Makes sure you know the material before the test. LOVED him!","This guy is hilarious. He will make awkward comments during class that just makes everyone laugh. The homework load isn't terrible, you only have an assignment the week of any of the quizzes. All of the quizzes are the same format, so it's never really a surprise. Quinn is great at teaching, and I learned quite a bit.

I did well in Stats but I have heard he is one of the most difficult.  For an easy A, get some one else.","If you have any high school mathematical background, this class is fluff.

I had taken Stat courses before so it was fairly easy for me but it's not an easy class for those who aren't familiar with statistics.  He does a pretty good job of breaking it down though.  Typical crazy math professor","Slightly scatterbrained at points, but he knows the material and knows how to break it down for math illiterates like me.

Expects you to use fancy long terms to describe processes and strategies that don't really have any substance or meaning. I felt like I was in a liberal arts class where the Prof. is trying to make something out of nothing!","Great class and dedicated Professor.  He expects work from you, but its worth it and very interesting.  I've him for two of my marketing classes and I'm always engaged and interested in the material.  He works hard to keep us updated with the latest marketing news and trends.  very real world!","Prof Wright is very knowledgeable and had interesting lectures. There are not a lot of assigments so the ones you do have you really have to do well on. Homework just consists of reading cases for class discussion. The group term project is pretty extensive and you dont get to pick your group!","Great Prof. Watch out for tests. Learn the slides by memory and the class is super easy. Team project is really easy as long as you meet early in the semester. Great intro to marketing class to take. Really funny at times.","Prof. Wright is an awesome prof.!! He is also a funny nice guy and very helpful.  He makes this class very easy but your walk away learning a lot.  No tests, just case write-ups and a group presentation. This class is definitely worth taking with him.","He was ok - a little strange. Tough grader given the fact that AFTER he turns graded assignments back he tells you how he wanted the assignment to be done. You'll learn a lot from the cases but he is not always clear on how he wants things to be done. Be careful...","Very entertaining. Class participation is a huge part of your grade. He grades tough on the case studies. No tests.","Probably the most interesting class I've been in.  The assignments were fun to do and I definitely learned from them.

He is old, but obviously experienced.  Very thorough in his teaching and willing to help out.  Still has a sense of humor and keeps class as lively as possible with dry subject matter.  Not sure how he is rated so terribly...the only way to fail his class is to not do work/not pay attention.  This is hardly a PROFESSORS fault...","Compartively probably one of the worst teachers in all of the finance department. He was an accounting teacher that taught the 201 course.  If you plan on this being ur major take a teacher whos actually in the department.","He tries, but his lectures are pretty much recitals of what's already in the textbook, but more confusing. The material is good, but look for someone else if you want your professor to actually contribute something to what you learn.","Wes****er was a bad professor. He copied the book onto the board and graded like a crazy old man. I am a 3.75 student, and I found it hard to get a B.

Doesn't seem to phase him when a majority of the class is failing (many grades below 50). Doesn't cover test material the day before a test, instead goes over new material not on the test. Little to no partial credit when there are 25 pt questions.

He gives knowledge outside of the textbook which is amazing to talk about when interviewing.","He's a nice guy, but his lectures follow no logic and he tries to involve the class in a way that makes the examples pointless.

You have to study alone with the text book and the online questions. Seems like an online class. Lectures are unecessary. The level is quite low so you learn only the basics, critical thinking or up to date topics are left out.","I hope you like teaching yourself Econ.

The professor usually tried to waste between 30-60 min of class time with random thoughts about nothing. 90% of learning came from simply reading the text. The prof. added no value and was often very unclear about assignments.

Recitations r super important.","This class is pretty interesting, but there is so much reading. Like, tons of reading. Study groups are essential. Professor Rodine Hardy doesn't lecture a whole lot, but you do a lot of group work and discussions. She is one of the most genuinely caring profs I've had. Make sure you pick a country you want to research for the entire semester.","There is a lot of reading for this class. Like, hundreds of pages a week. It forces you to learn how to skim and get the main ideas. If you like Model UN, you might be one of the few students who gets excited about all the readings and takes notes and is a huge participant in class discussions. I found it difficult to keep up.","It would have been a more interesting class if she was better organized. We never knew what was expected of us and when asking specific questions, she wouldn't give a direct answer. She is a really nice person outside of class though.","Prof Hardy is clearly very knowledgeable and very engaged with students. She loves when students participate and is very eager to work with them. However, I did not enjoy her lectures at all, and I felt that we spent way too much time covering unimportant material, and not enough time on crucial textbook stuff.  The O'Neil textbook is ESSENTIAL","While I understand that people don't like her because of her disorganization, she is one of the better professors, especially if you're willing to participate and to do a little bit of extra work like reading the news.  Otherwise, no complaints.  Do the readings because most of the class discussions revolve around articles from the Rogowski book.","She is a professor who placed a huge emphasis on reading the textbook, but would fail at explain the theories in class and how it related to what you learned. Extremely dull lectures, and fake enthusiasm for her students. For her midterms and finals make sure you specifically mention the authors, or ull do poorly","Rodine-Hardy is very nice and teaches a lot of information, but I wouldn't recommend the class unless it is a major requirement solely for the amount of reading (120-150/week).  I did learn how to skim properly though which will be useful for my college career in the long run.  Overall professor very nice and TAs even nicer (Diane anyway).","Don't take IR with her!!! The class is boring, too much assigned reading, and she and her TAs grade incredibly hard/strictly. She sort of looks down on all of her students in a weird way.","Very dull class. An unreasonable amount of reading and she treats students like children. If you enjoy useless theories that mean nothing in today's world, take her class.","She's smart and enthusiastic, but DON'T TAKE IR WITH HER. There's SOOOO much reading; it's overwhelming. The lectures are insanely boring as well.","i had her for an intro to IR and I think she over did it. reading was about 140 pages a week. for an intro it was a bit much bt you do learn alot. Midterm and final arent that hard tho pretty simple but its because she prepares you really well with the reading and lectures. I ended the class with a B. tough but if you do your work you will be happy","had her for IPE. bery knowledgabe and a very nice person. looking back i definitely learned more than i realized at the time. have no complaints other than she assigns lots of readings.","Had her for a 100-level Int'l Relations class. Readings were 130-140 pages a week. Students complain, but her excuse is &quot;you aren't in high school anymore, grow up&quot;. I haven't seen the halls of a high school since 2006. Her lectures are entirely theory based, and boring. I have done int'l co-ops and have a strong background in the field, hated this","I took International Political Economy with Professor Hardy in 2007. The class was really tough at times, but looking back I learned a lot so it was worth it. She is really nice and very smart. The readings were important and so were class discussions. If you're interested in economics, it is a very interesting course.","This professor is useless. Te content of the class is very interesting but the teacher makes it painful. No lectures but rather group discussions on the readings, that nobody reads. She has office hours for two hours before class... that's it and does not return e-mails. Take another class if you want to learn something. She does not teach.","I would highly recommend taking International Relations with another professor. Not helpful at all. All she teaches is theory and every lecture is the same (and boring). Exams and papers are ridiculous. This could have been a very interesting class had it been taught differently.","Sometimes you'll hate the class but at the end of the day it's worth it.

I went to every single class and took notes, studied my butt off and still didn't do well on the tests. save yourself a lot of misery and find another class to fill the core. I put a lot of effort into his class and ended up with a grade that killed my gpa.","Very confusing and misleading. Didn't tell us the Term paper should be 12-20 pages long until 2 days before it was due. Inconsistent grader and very boring with a tendency to ramble on about things that have nothing to do with the course. 1/5 would not take a class with him again.","This class was so pointless. He spent all of class telling pointless stories about his time on different research projects, but never actually taught the material.  For the homework, you had to teach yourself and usually didn't do well because there were only a few questions worth a ton of points.  Don't take this class unless you have to.","Super nice professor. LOVES the subject. I was not into the subject but I learned a lot. He creates his own textbook which is nice because it follows along with what he is teaching and only tells you what you need to know for the quizzes. Have to study the book and notes in order to do well on the tests. Also gives makeup quizzes for bad grades.","NEEDS a hearing aid. Boring class. Nice guy but really should retire. Not very organized power points and mostly pictures. Frustrating.","so some of the content is challenging and some is easy. homeworks can be the same way but dont count for much. interesting class we look at slides the entire time. marty is nice and good teacher. only 4 tests which are fair, no participation, you can skip if you want but it makes the tests a little harder, attendance 3 x for extra cred. def take it","Ross is a very funny and nice guy. He knows his stuff and he is very passionate about what he teaches. However, the class itself is too boring and the tests are somewhat hard. TRY to pay attention to lectures because the first test material comes A LOT from the lectures.","Ehhhhh.","Ross knows his stuff but he isn't that great at conveying it to college students trying to pass an easy elective. The classpac has everything. He tells you what to study(which is a lot) Towards the end, homeworks weren't explained as well and not so many in class exercises. Extra credit sometimes in class. overall not bad :D","Great Professor.  Interesting topic.  Class can be a little bit boring towards the end of the semester.  Final comes DIRECTLY from quizzes and quizzes come DIRECTLY from hw.  So if you really do the hw its an easy A.  Stay awake and don't interrupt.   Wants you to understand.  If you have to take micro go for this teacher!","This rating is more about the class than the professor - Ross is very knowledgeable is his field and a funny guy, but is terrible at explaining things on a basic level. Homeworks are hard and graded, tests are manageable.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A AN EASY ELECTIVE AS A SENIOR!!. Take another natural sciences class instead.","Terrible. He teaches as if everyone's a geologist. It's a 1-credit lab that requires more work than any of my 4-credit real classes. The lab isn't in sync with the real DynEarth class, so prepare to get confused. Also, he grades poorly and inconsistently between identical labs. He hovers around the geo people and gives them priority.","Class can be boring and the tests are a little difficult because they're mostly based on map analysis. If you know of other classes that would fill your requirements, its recommended that you take those instead.  Overall not a bad class, just not a good one.","Not a bad class but a mistake as an elective. Attendance not mandatory but it helps if you go.  75% of the tests are maps so don't concentrate on lists or anything like that. Nice guy and very clear and obviously passionate about his profession.","Nice guy really, but I couldn't have been happier to get my drop form filled. Hope you like geology, cause if not...you better really pay attention. No book though, just a packet. He just expects people to know what he's talking about, which may not always be the case when some of us are just taking this to fill our natural world requirement.","SO EASY. I skipped more often than not, handed in all my homework and got an A-. Everything that you would EVER need to know is in the packet. Everything he writes on the board, he has already written in the packet for you, and he never strays from it. Funny guy, shows slideshows and tells stories. Doesn't teach, but will explain if you're lost. :)","LOVED HIM. the subject matter didn't interest me personally...the only reason i really went to class was because he was so awesome. lots of slide shows - it's not too bad. read the packets and know details. he's the greatest man ever.","doesn't explain much and expects you to know what you are doing even if you havent taken a geo class before. goofy and funny, but very unclear teaching style. means good, wants you to figure it out on your own, but takes it too far in this class.

He seemed to teach specifically for people who had taken Calc BC in high school and this was just a review for them. Pretty difficult to understand if this will be new material for you. Little to no in class review and less than helpful in preparing for classes. Just saying, there are a ton of better professors","This professor is amazing! I was hard for me to sometimes follow him in class because he has a tendency to go through his lectures fast (usually finishing class before the class time is over yet still covering everything we need to know) but the notes he writes on the board make up for it 100% I even had friends from other classes borrow my notes!","Marco is a very clear in his lectures and doesn't waste time asking his students to solve problems individually in class. He moves quickly and spends the majority of the time in the class with his back turned writing on the black board, so be prepared to take a lot of notes. He also often will let you out of class early!","It;s a really easy class and he is a super chill professor.

Everything he explained made perfect sense and was very interesting and thus easy to remember and reapply. Taking good notes is extremely helpful and he makes it very easy, I just wrote down what he wrote on the board and I had everything I needed later.","Professor Marco Rainho or just Marco is an amazing professor. For someone who had to retake Calc 3, I'd say he made everything understandable and had analogies that made this class bearable. He is always helpful at office hours and makes sure you understand the content. Scaling your final grade is not his forte, You get what you earn :)","The digital textbooks (by Massey) are extremely confusing. Rainho bases his lectures off the books, but explains the material in his own clear way. I've never been exceptional at calculus but I really enjoyed his class. He keeps it fun. He provides homework but doesn't require it, so I guess that's nice if calc comes easy to you (unlike me!)","Very good overall, though in first few weeks he definitely rushed the material and didn't pay much attention to students. Later in the course this stopped, and he was fine.","Great math teacher overall! Funny, approachable, intelligent, and clear.","I love him! He has a dry, sarcastic sense of humor, and you'll hear him say \"probs\" and \"funsies.\" The class itself takes a lot of effort, but he makes the class more entertaining. He doesn't like the book and complains that he has to follow it, but I like his methods better. Overall, awesome teacher!","Really chill teacher, has a great sense of humor and explains material well. Goes a bit fast though so you have to be attentive, took him only one week to know the name of each student in class. He is really helpful if you need extra help and quizzes are not too hard.","I am totally a Humanities student and math was never my thing, but Marco's class was one of my favorites at Northeastern. He not only speaks English as his first language (rare, I know) but is very clear in his lessons, friendly, and helpful. A great sense of humor and a serious dedication to knowing his students sealed the deal for a great class.","Rainho is pretty chill. He's sort of new so he bases his notes off of the textbook. His tests' difficulty are reasonable and he is very approachable for help. Rest assured, his first language is English and he has rather nice handwriting.","One of my favorites, even though he's new.

She also racially screened participants while filling out the demographic survey.

I listened in class, participated occasionally, didn't really read the text book and still got an A.","Prior to signing up for her class, I read numerous mixed reviews, unfortunately I decided to take the course with Prof Randall.  If you are contemplating whether or not to listen to the negative reviews, listen to the negative reviews.  Her course was too difficult for an intro course.  She was rude and condescending.  Find another professor.","if it was not for my tutor I would have never understood anything in this class. Her teaching methods were just hard for me to understanding, so i did not rely on her to teach me. The textbook was not helpful.  The final exam was a horrible and brutal assessment. It was disorganized & confusing to my entire class. #anxietyattack","I really liked Janet.  I found that as long as you participated in class, she really appreciated it.  I don't know if I'd call it favoritism per se... But she really loves linguistics, and wants everyone in her class to be as excited about it as she is.","I strongly disliked her and dreaded going to her class. She wouldhave us come in to her office to get one on one time with her. Our class started with 19 people and ended with 11 or less. I found her rude and believed she was above everyone; her opinions were the only ones that mattered. She also made us pay $20 out of pocket for two dumb packets","Janet is a good professor despite the fact that she may play favorites. While she comes off as being harsh, she isn't. She won't take you seriously as a student if you don't take her class seriously. She flat out told me I was not one of her favorites, however, she realized that I was serious and not going anywhere and she warmed up to me instantly","If you haven't taken Intro. to Linguistics with Sarah Hulsey, DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS.

The 100 min run time is excruciating and she is unhelpful and always late. Just take something else. For the midterm the only information she gave us was that it would be on chapters 1-7.

DO NOT take this class unless you have taken intro. to ling. Professor Randall is confusing though she means well.  Her &quot;Tell Me More&quot; question assignments are not helpful but are required. I took this to fulfill the level 2 analytical core requirement.  Class is mostly smug linguistics majors.","Great teacher. Dry sense of humor. Good at keeping class on track, despite our wildest tangents. Very fair, *really* makes you think about the material. (She requires you to write two &quot;Tell Me More&quot; questions for each chapter of the book: Good questions the text raised for you but were not answered in the chapter.)","If she likes you, you will do well. You have to do a lot of sucking up to get to that status, however. I spent hours literally a week with a tutor and studying alone, only to receive a D by the end of the semester.

There was a lot of digression, and she's not the most exciting teacher, but I thought the class was pretty straight-forward and reasonable.","Her teaching style wasn't very interesting; she was monotone and digressed often. What I would think would have been an interesting topic became extremely boring when she taught it.When I,worried, asked for help on an essay homework I did badly on,she said I was overreacting;the next day she called me out on it in front of the class. Not worth it.","I registered just to post on her. She made me feel awful and ruined my whole exp. at NU. I asked her for help in a difficult class, she told me to just study harder. She was my advisor and she was awful- downright mean and rude. If I saw her today, I would tell her to quit teaching and do something that would make her happy- because she is frigid.","I had Randall in 1993 before this site existed and I just had to see what current students think of her.  Back then, she was mean, rude and unprofessional. Apparently, we share the same unfortunate experience.  She is beyond awful.  A perfect example of how tenure can be abused and should probably be done away with. How does she keep her job&#63;","She is a terrible snobby woman, completely unhelpful and unclear.  Wastes class time with meaningless group work, blames problems on students, her teaching style is very very backward and when approached with questions is not at all helpful.  Avoid her classes.  Just because she is head of the department is no excuse for this type of behavior.","She is the worst teacher I've ever encountered at NU.  Beyond rude and extremely unprofessional.

The readings are not too long, and are a great selection. She's really passionate about literature, and it comes through in her discussions. Most of the work is Blackboard posts, which isn't too hard. She's a really caring and funny person, and she even brought us snacks sometimes.","TuSmith is engaging and really gets the class involved in discussions! Reading is required. Blackboard posts, and the occasional essay. She brings up your posts and validates all opinions. Gives out snacks, is genuinely nice and enthusiastic and is one of my favorite professors-absolutely adorable. Easy essay grader. SmallSeminar with 11 students.","Prof. TuSmith is an enthusiastic and energetic instructor. I would just say that she could do a better job of engaging students in discussion rather than imposing her own ideas about the text onto her class through long tangents. She is forgiving, even though I missed a lot of classes due to personal issues, she gave me a second chance to pass.","The most adorable professor in existence. I took her Modern Short Story class and it was easily my favorite class. The reading is short and to the point -- she doesn't waste your time or give you busy work. 3 papers a semester and she grades pretty easily. She often brings snacks for the class like cookies & is just generally friendly.","Whoever said Professor TuSmith can't speak English is just being rude and ra cist. She's a professor in the ENGLISH DEPARTMENT; she's extremely well versed in both the English language and American literature. She's very smart although she does go off-topic quite a bit. The class is interesting; she is very conversationally engaging. Easy grader.","I highly enjoyed her Asian American literature course. Though in part I think it was fun because of the people who were in the class, together it was a great atmosphere to be in. People who badmouth her...they probably did it because they couldn't deal with having to face racial or ethnic issues and this is a major part of her courses.","Classic teacher! Bonnie is easily one of my favorites. I can't quite say why, though. She likes me, I suppose thats why. Just be sure to get her off topic and ask her about her karate skills. I challenged her to a fight several times but she wouldn't engage me. Weak.","Bonnie is actually one of the most intelligent professors at NU, and those who say otherwise are too dumb too recognize that. She doesn't coddle you, but she does give you credit where it's due. She is fluent in like, 6 languages, and she is extremely well versed in many different kinds of ethnic lit., not just Asian. She is legit, worth taking.","The 1 positive thing about this class was that the book selection was impecable. I read magazines during class every day or did puzzles. Lectures are completely useless and your forced to read bc of blackboard postings, and then she just tells you wat you read the whole class time. Never helpful, always chnges the subject, doesnt seem to know much.","I did not mind TuSmith. She does tend to get off topic sometimes and relates to her asian-american culture, but so what! She is an easy grader.","Easy class, easy grader.  She is better with a smaller class and yes she does go off topic a lot and talks a lot about culture and heritage which I don't think is necessarily all that bad.  Just read, do your essays and you'll be fine.","She tries to turn every subject to herself and her asian-american heritage.  assigns books for class regarding ethnicity regardless of legitimacy to topic.  No offense, but she is not all that bright.  I've asked several questions and she says &quot;oh, that's an intersting thought&quot; and then changes the subject and does not answer them.","Professor TuSmith is perhaps better with smaller groups of students. I had her for a seminar and she was great, much more of a conversational instuctor than a lecturing instructor needed for a larger class. She does go off topic. The smaller classes are better, big classes don't bother going to class sometimes.","you could work really hard and get A's for your papers but still end up with a C. grading scheme isridiculous+illogical. no common sense not understanding only talks abt herself.also forces her opinions down your throat evn if it has nothing to do w/theclass. she needs to get ovr herself.","She can go on and on and on and go off on tangents about things. Very nice woman though, grades really easy although the final paper is ROUGH. The class is a bore, but if you need it to fulfill a requirement, take it. Zone out during class, your'll be fine.","i agree, she's extremely self-centered. 1 time i went to talk to her after class & she went on & on about other stuff instead of answering my question! i think i was there for 30 or 40 min. before she finally answered my question. the class itself isn't hard but she keeps repeating her resume to us.","Can't speak english and makes her own students correct essays........... no clue where she's coming from.","doesnt teach the material, but very easy grader. going to class is a huge nap time.","This teacher was awful, I would have enjoyed the class if it had'nt been for her.

Class is easy as long as you go to class. Also she lets you make a cheat sheet. I recommend taking her.","She really won't help if you havent had any stats before. She has a daily thick accent and gets very aggravated when people ask questions. She also goes through the material too quickly. Your best bet is to write everything down and try and learn and understand it afterwards.","She's very nice with pretty Bulgarian accent. Stats may get a bit difficult, but she teaches before we have to do the homework. She covers the material in detail. 3 midterms, 2 individual projects and a final.  The group projects are extremely easy.

Definitely passionate about chemistry, especially Orgo. It's hard, but you do learn a lot through out the course. He also gives plenty of opportunities of extra credit, so that's always great.","Professor Toher was one of the best lecturers I have ever had. He is clearly very passionate about chemistry (especially orgo) and cares a lot about his students' learning. His lecture style is very clear and understandable. He provided us with lecture podcasts. Lots of chances for extra credit to boost your grade. Exams are hard- YOU MUST STUDY.","Professor Toher is an amazing instructor! Yes, his lectures are long.  BUT he makes jokes during them (which I found hilarious) and he really wants you to understand the material and to pass!  He offers online study groups the night before the exams and he answers questions that you have and will tell you if the material is going to be on the test.","This is not an easy class by any means. Toher is tough, probably the hardest Chem professor at Nu, but the amount you learn is incredible. I got a B in the class and Im scoring 85th and 90th percentile on MCAT chem related questions. What does that tell you? Hard class, but put in the work and you won't regret it.","Yes, his exams are difficult. However, he lectures very well and really makes sure students get a firm grasp of the material. He tests you on understanding, not just pure memorization. He provides lecture captures, which were super helpful when reviewing for exams. There are lots of opportunities to raise your grade and they aren't hard to get done","My grade improved from a C+ in Chem1 (w/ Davies) to a B in Chem2--all thanks to prof Toher. Yes the class is hard, but if you go to class and do all the homework you'll be fine. He is INCREDIBLY helpful in and outside of class (has his own chem tutoring business). You may struggle with the midterms, but he makes up for it with a semi-easy final.","Prof Toher is a pretty funny guy and definitely knows his stuff when it come to Chemistry. His exams are difficult but get better as the semester goes on.  Powerpoints are very easy to understand and he explains everything in great detail but the class is tough","Chris is a great teacher. He knows everything, presents it in moderately clear ways, and explains things many ways. He is great in office hours, and expects his students to try their hardest. If you want to learn chemistry, take Chris' class.","Toher is the best. He's crystal clear and is very interested in the material. He's tough though. He's all about moving quickly so take notes and pay attention or you will be left behind. He's very funny.","Naturally good at Chem or took AP Chem? Then you shouldn't worry too much.  Haven't taken Chem in a while?  Prepare to have a brutal first semester. Toher is a good teacher, but his breakneck pace and his habit of explaining very difficult concepts in a 30 second slide makes him more suitable to teach upper-level courses, not a chemistry I class.","I took AP Chem in high school and I didn't want a repetitive course. Toher made it more of a very helpful review of the things I learned in AP Chem. I felt that the class pace was fast in general, and would be hard for those who have not been exposed to chemistry before. However, his chem class was very enjoyable.","Professor Toher is the best.

Textbook not discussed in class, yet she expects it in the exams/papers, which is why the grading is tough. Loved her, but would recommend to people that are interested in the class and ready to commit. If you want an A pick someone else.","Illingworth is very knowledge about the topics but her lectures are lacking. For the majority of the class lectures were based off of group projects done by students. There are few grades in the class and she is an extremely tough grader. Her lectures can be confusing and you are forced to supplement the material in order to pass the tests.","She has an average 3.1 as of right now, and I think that's 3.1 points too high. She sucks. She's really boring and dry. She doesn't teach much, just talks about anything she feels like talking about. She doesn't tell you anything about the upcoming test, so you're left studying anything from the book. Wouldn't recommend taking this class.","Prof. Illingworth is solid, but the class is HARD. You really need to read and understand the material, so you can participate in class discussion, or you won't pass. She's not available often to talk to or go to for help, but in class she speaks passionately about the material, and really knows her stuff. That said, it can be very confusing.","I really enjoyed the class, but she grades VERY hard, and provides very little feedback and support.   Almost all of this class is lecture and discussion. No powerpoint, you have to transcribe what she says as she goes on.   Illington is a great professor, but the brutal grading and lack of office hours makes her one to avoid.","She's a very confusing professor and can often times be rude. Lectures are pretty long so be prepared. She loves debatingarguing so participation is necessary. I would recommend going to class and the book is good to have as a reference. There are two tests and I just studied my class notes and skimmed the text and got a good grade.","She's kinda hard to reach. Doesn't reply emails. Doesn't have much office hour. Her lectures are okay but she simply isn't helpful at all. Also, she's sometimes condescending. Don't recommend.","Terrible teacher, if you don't see an idea her way it is wrong even if it is a completely open ended question.  Hard to talk to out of class and when you do gives you misguidance rather than help. Avoid her if you can.","Shows up late almost every time.  Rambles incoherently often.  VERY conceited.  Does not seem to have a lesson plan some days, and often relies on her students to teach portions of the class through presentations.","Do NOT take Busn Ethics as a Freshman! It's a complex Philosophy Class that won't help you in your immediate future. The class is mostly discussion, but the grades are heavily weighed on 4 essays that are graded strictly. If you go to her for help though, she's very fair and gives you advice and extra time. She's a great person, but a tough teacher","Took Business Ethics. Although teacher is a bleeding-heart liberal, the class is engaging, the discussions relevant, and the issues presented are interesting. Open-forum class format, teacher is very open to anyone's opinions. I recommend the class.","Took business ethics.Great professor and tries to engauge the whole class. Midterm and a final with a paper... Thought she was a hard grader although I knew all the terms.","Illingworth gets a bad rap on this site. Philosophy majors, like me, know that she is very good. You can learn a lot from her and she is very helpful to students who want to learn. Unfortunately, she teaches large classes to students in med and business related programs who don't get philosophy. They lack motivation, give up, slack off, blame her.","An open forum class that allows free expression and fosters creative thought among students.  The unorthodox class structure provides a break from the monotony of college lecture classes.","This is a very interesting class. It is pretty much just a class discussion/debate each week. There are 2 essays, one midterm and a take home final which is an essay. All in all a great way to fulfill the arts/humanities req. Professor Illingworth does a great job teaching the course and it is not stressful. I recommend it.","Horrible. SO BAD. DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING IT.","Dr. Illingworth is a very intelligent professor,however, she is not a great teacher.She has a set of things she wants to talk about and she proceeds with them not paying attention to the class.She assumes that everyone knows as much as she does.She doesn't spend enough time explaining the basics to students.I felt like I was in graduate school...","The topics discussed in this class are really interesting to me. I actually enjoyed going to class sometimes when we discussed interesting or controversial issues. She tends to take a side on an issue and won't be afraid to basically say you are wrong. However, she's still nice and it's not too hard of a class. Just participate a lot!","She is a great teacher.  She's perfect to take a class with because she talks about interesting things so you can participate and get into interesting discussions/debates, but you can also zone out and it doesnt matter.  She's really smart, engaging, and relaxed.  You can get along fine without ever reading the book.","She definitely knows her stuff, and does a good job of advocating multiple sides of an issue without compromising her own conclusions. The worst part of the class is listening to other students spout off personal opinions and irrelevant anecdotes, but Illingworth is great.

Show up 2 classes before the test because thats when he tells you exactly what topic each question is on.","Don't take if you dont have a solid background in economics. Don't go to lecture as he just talks about random events. Go to recitation. Do aplia hw (easy if you already know some econ). 1 research paper, easy A if you do some research.

She is hilarious, passionate, and always makes class fun by singing and encouraging students to get creative with projects. Learned a lot from her and would take another course with her again in a heartbeat.","Piccillo is the woman! She dances and sings! She grades fairly hard for no reason, but really cares about the students and works to make us better.  We had so much fun in this class: I'll never forget it! I would recommend anyone take her Oral Interp Class, but I heard that the Public Speaking can be a bit tedious (mostly due to the subject matter)","Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! She really knows what she is talking about and has a great style of teaching to go along with her entertaining personality. Take her classes.","Horrible!!! She is the worst teacher ever. She is extremely rude and has a horrible grading system. Tons of useless work that she assigns and ALWAYS makes excuses as to why she doesn't return grades until weeks after it was due.

She's always willing to talk to you about any questions or problems, she is extremely engaging and obviously cares about all of her students.  Without a doubt the best professor I've had at Northeastern, she's managed to make Public Speaking an exciting and challenging class.","Public Speaking is never fun, but you don't actually have to give that many speeches.  I took Speech in highschool and did more work than I did in this class.  She's very energetic and outgoing, and every other class she'll do this weird leg kick as she twists her body and make a noise like &quot;waaah!&quot; or say &quot;whoa!&quot;, it kept me awake and laughing.","Great teacher, great woman. I seek out classes that Ms. P is teaching. Whether or not you are enjoying the material, you enjoy her as a person and (unlike my other classes) I actually dont mind getting out of bed for this one. She keeps everything interesting, lively, upbeat, and most importantly, even the most dull is FUN with this professor.","One of the best professors at the School.  Every Comm student should take a class with Ms. P.","The artsy type. Vibrant personality but awful teacher. Very bias as to what she thinks public speaking should be about versus what it is supposed to be about. Grades are impossible to improve, you make a niche on your first speech and are stuck in that grade range for duration of semester. Very frustrating to have her as a teacher.","She is my favorite professor as of now. Really nice, and ready to help you. but really, work to earn her respect. Don't get behind!","Very fun, energetic, crazy. She is hilarious but very serious about her classes- you will learn alot but you also will be challenged. V&A has some very hard exams, but if you practice speaking you'll be fine. Presentation, Style, and Communication is also easy if you practice and rehearse. Just about the best Comm prof I've had, period.","If you don't want to get better at public speaking don't take the class.  You do have to prove to her that you can improve, and actually work.  It can be simple and easy, you just have to make it that way.  She's very impactful, and truely cares about students.  She is a little crazy, but it's what makes her so great.","She's reaaaally out there. Be careful...she seems like an easy grader but she's not.

Tough grader but absolutely worth the work, won't be bored, won't fall asleep, take anything she teaches, you won't be sorry!","I had Susan Picillo for my Voice and Articulation as well as my public speaking class and she was easily one of the best professors I have had.

Had a pretty bad Orgo 1 professor, so I was used to teaching myself everything from the textbook. Pollastri, however, actually taught the material, so the only time I used my textbook was when I needed to review something, clear something up, or practice probs.","He is pretty organized and gives extra credit. Don't rely on the curve and always keep up and study. He follows the book very closely and I would definitely go to lecture/recitation as he sometimes covers specific reactions or special cases not in the book. Read the chapters (they aren't very long) and I stress heavily do the homework.","Questions on exams were concepts that were never covered in lectures. Moved fast in class and claimed to hate memorization but wrote exams in a way that didn't reflect it. A nice guy, but sometimes came off sounding annoyed and exasperated with students' questions in online communication (discussion board posts, emails). Overall, a fair professor.","Professor Pollastri is a singularly patient and compassionate instructor. If you put in the hours, the class is easy. The grading is incredibly fair--VERY generous curve. Prof. Pollastri constantly reminds his students to keep the faith and never underestimate what hard work can do. It is easy to love Organic when you have a teacher like this.","One of the best Chem professors I have ever had.  Was very energetic and really wanted us to do well in the class.  It was a hard class but I really understood the concepts of Orgo 2 without memorizing it.  Reading the book helps a lot to follow along.  If you ever have the opportunity to take a class with Prof. Pollastri DO IT!","Use of MasteringChem HW was terrible, from the software issues that he was aware of and the arbitrary times for due dates. Goes too fast in lecture and makes many mistakes.","Pollastri is full of enthusiasm and loves students.  The first two tests are fairly straightforward but READ READ READ the book, do all the practice problems, and do not skip class!   He does move fast, but not mind-bogglingly so and he records all the lessons.  Overall, fantastic professor.","Pollastri is my hero. I love him. He is a very clear, eager, and hilarious teacher.

Class is hard no matter who the prof, but he's really fair. Tips- Do the homework and study from that! Exam questions are often based directly off homework questions. Also, go to reviews and office hours whenever possible.","Im taking orgo1 with him right now. Hes very clear and easy to follow during lecture-young, down to earth guy. I don't go to reviews-not sure if he's helpful there. He posts videos of all lectures on blackboard. Tests are easy. Ive taken the first 2 so far.

Stay away from him","In Calc 2, the material isn't too hard; however, Porter overcomplicates everything so that students are more confused. The textbook is too technical, to the point that it's useless.  Porter once spent a class going over one problem; a student w/ another teacher showed me to do it in 2 min. Avoid Porter.

He's very clear and is willing to answer questions. Drops 3 quizzes and there are tons of extra credit opportunities. That being said, do not skip class or the homework. They are important even though he never checks them","You will constantly have to teach yourself new concepts from the overly-complicated textbook since he uses essentially all of the class time on review and quizzes.

Only complaint is he seemed unnecessarily hard in grading final presentation","Not bad. Lectures done well and he has a lot of experience in the field. He is very clear about what he wants for assignments and is very strict about getting that. Exams are a little tricky - but he does let you dispute questionable answers. Again, strict, but gets his point across well.","Worst professor I've ever had. Huge workload for an introductory class. Tests are very hard. Hard to take notes he whizzes through powerpoints and doesn't allow laptops. AVOID","He's actually a really nice guy. He was really understanding and helpful towards me.","avoid at all costs.... test heavy class and hard OVERALL.  AVOOD HIM GUYS!!!!","No practice for tests forever","He is clear about what he teaches. Super interested in his subject. His tests are fair game and not easy to ace if you dont study. Lots of his homework answers can be found online. Participation is important so make sure he knows your name","A bloated, inconsiderate, do-things-strictly-by-his-own-arbitrary-book kind of guy. Has the most inane and draconian attendance rules; if you're late to class even by a minute, you're counted absent all day. He refuses to except late work. He lacks total sympathy, even scoffed when I told him my grandfather was dying. A bureaucratic oaf.","Professor Power is the most rude and disrespectful professor I've ever had the displeasure of \"learning\" from at Northeastern. He acts like he could care less about how you perform in his class and is not willing to help at all when asked. If you want to save your GPA, don't take this guy.","In-class participation and coming to class is 20% of your grade. His tests are 50 multiple choice questions (averages: 80-84) Not an easy A, you must work for it. Make sure to be as creative as possible whenever you have a presentation. He expects a lot from you. Overall he is a very nice guy but I don't really think he is that good of a professor.","No negotiations, no slack, very strict when it comes to participation and tardiness. Penalized me for missing classes that I didn't miss. Lectures are well-explained and tests are fair, but policies are unforgiving.","Professor power has little to no interest in helping anyone in class. He just zooms through material, tells you only to study his slideshows, then the exams are on book material and anything else he decides. Avoid at all costs.","The worst professor I have ever had at Northeaster. Extremely hard exams and he doesn't make you feel comfortable to participate in class. I regretted taking the transportation class with him. Avoid if you can!","I loved this class. It is VERY hard to get an A in but I felt that I learned a lot. The tests are hard and sometimes the questions misleading.

The tests he writes are grammatically incorrect which makes it difficult to understand the questions that are being asked. He gives little to no feedback for means of improvement. His grading is arbitrary and he provides no basis upon where he makes up his numbers. DO NOT TAKE HIM!","Goes through power points too fast for you to write things down.

DONT TAKE HIM.","Lectures make material seem super easy, but the tests will get you","Great person, really cares about his students. If you're rude he doesn't tolerate it. He works hard for every student he has and wants to see effort from us. Makes class SOO enjoyable. So much knowledge for the field, and has great connections. Always willing to help students.","The thing people don't like about this prof is that he's very blunt. You can take that to mean a good thing or a bad thing.

Awesome guy, must take for Corporate Finance","He is a tough teacher - knows his stuff but if you aren't a finance major or really interested in the subject, not the teacher for you. He is unlike the other teachers - does not test on formulas, just spreadsheets and the thinking behind formulas, so if you don't understand the material 110%, you will not do as well","This guy knows his finance but it is a very hard class. You must participate all the time and he will call you out if you don't speak a lot. He is always willing to explain things which is nice. Also, Some of his tests and quizzes are super easy and others are impossibly hard. Nothing is consistent with this guy.","Amazing professor! He may not not teach exactly what is in the book, but you end up learning a lot!","Uses a diff calculator than everyone else. Grades very hard and exams ar eimpossible. You might as well guess on the multiple choice. He is a funny guy but not alot of learning is done because he is not clear at all.","Prof Swasey has a lot of experience in the finance world. He really drives real world examples in his class and neglects the textbook. This is very frustrating when aplias are due and you have no idea how to do them.

She gave pretty straightforward lectures. Her pace can be fast at times and she doesn't always explain the material, but regurgitating the formulas on the tests will serve you just fine.","Best math professor ever!!","Great teacher, occasional nuggets of humor make every lecture worth it. Accent/English not perfect, but makes things more interesting in my opinion","her notes are really good","Great teacher. Her notes are crystal clear, just make sure she sees you when you raise your hand","She goes pretty fast and can be a bit hard to understand at times.

She tells you the essays ahead of time, so just be very clear on the exam.","Although pretty irreverent for anybody's beliefs, I think that Setta really tried to tell things like they were. A lot of what she said could be offensive if you're closed-minded, but the information was useful and surprisingly applicable in looking deeper into religions. Pretty easy class in all, go to lectures though!","Probably one of my favorite teachers I've had at NU- despite the fact that she's a complete scatterbrain and her notes reflect that.  She can be pretty confusing but she genuinely wants everyone to do well and if you go to her office hours, she'll really help you out. she's also the funniest teacher I've ever had","Very knowledgeable and opinionated, and teaches an interesting subject very well. Tests are tough, but after the first one you more or less know what to expect. Take good notes.","She is very fun, and she tends to have an enlightening stood-back broad view on world religions and cultures.  But this means that she is very opinionated, and she is unsympathetic towards closed minded students.  She has unique views on religious dogma, especially Western, that would probably horrify most strict evangelists.","You have to go to class and take good notes in order to do well. Her power points are worthless and her lectures are all over the place. Bring your computer and type every single word she says. Then read it over before an exam and it'll be an easy A. She's entertaining and approachable. Be prepared to memorize 20+ religions!","I have her for the Meaning of Death and while she keep a 300+ person lecture interesting, it can get boring sometimes.  Sit towards the front or she doesn't see you.  She tends to misquote and mix facts up, too.  Lots of reading and you need to go to class - her powerpoints aren't worth much.  Not a hard class and the subject matter isnt to complex","I acknowledge that while this class is absolutely huge, Setta does a good job.  She's lively, and tries to get people involved.  However, the tests are all memory, and I will not retain most of the information from this class.  Hopefully, this will improve.  On our last test, she sent an email stating our grades ranged from 23 to 98.3....","Very tough class. Her lectures are scattered and difficult to follow. However, if you go to her for extra help she is incredibly nice and a big help. She is very passionate but it can be at times a boring class.

It is a tough class but you will learn a lot.","She's awesome, very interesting and passionate about cultures/religions. The only problem is her tests. They're matching but hard and vague. You have to try to read her mind to do well and remember the little things she talked about in class.","Great professor.  She is really funny and makes the material interesting.  Difficult tests, so study hard and take lots of notes!  Tests are based on notes, not on text at all.  The papers were easy as long as you had a general idea of the readings.  Definitely a really good experience..if you have a chance to take her, do it!!","Had her for Meaning of Death. Skipped class for more than three weeks straight and sparknoted all the readings, never got below a 90 on the exams. She's very clear, funny, and tries to involve all the students as best as she can. It's still ALL notes and ALL memorization, so if you can get the notes and read them for long enough, it's easy.","Best class I've ever taken. I'm not a Philosophy major...though i considered becoming one cuz of this class and Prof. Setta. Ok, so u dont get the 1-on-1 some people like, but its a college lecture so get over it. She was VERY clear, even tho it was alot of material, but SO interesting. She's sweet too and makes good connections/examples.","This was a huge class w/ 4 TA's. If u go to class the exams werent impossible. The first exam was very bad, and I believed she took that into consideration the next two exams. Not recommended for anyone who's not philosophy majors. I thought this would be a fun/non-stressful class before graduating.Boy was I wrong.My GPA bombed cause of this class.","professor setta is unfit to teach large groups of students/non-philosophy majors. her style is vauge, her powerpoints useless and her sense of humor NOT funny [ie:she presented students a 'study guide' for the midterm. it was a full page of terms with no spaces in between aka of completely no use.] turned me off from the subject. not worth it.","this class IS death. setta is the most unclear teacher i have ever had in all my college experience. philosophy majors probably like her because shes such a whack. i called her two days ago and e-mailed her in advance and she has not contacted me back. she complains that we send her too many e-mails...um...hello you're a teacher.","For the person who talked about cumulative tests and review sheets... umm, we're in college now.

But in a class where all of her students were freshmen, she consistently failed to outline what she was asking for in our papers and let our grades suffer as a result. To be fair, a pretty hefty curve is applied at the end, but don't rely on that curve. Good luck if you have her! (you'll need it)","Strauss is unbelievably  hard and does not care about her students. She is very rude and thinks so highly of herself that she does not see that her students have no idea what she is talking about. She expects graduate level work from freshmen and sophomores. No matter how hard you study, you will not do well unless you can literally read her mind.","Don't get me wrong, Professor Strauss is very accomplished and she has so much knowledge to share. I just think as someone as informed as her, she expects too much from her students, most of whom are freshman. As a result, some of the material she goes over, is very hard to follow. She genuinely wants you to learn and understand the material.","Took her Cancer Biology Inquiries class. Heh.   There's no point of studying for her quizzes, because you'll not do well anyways. Her powerpoint notes are next to useless (and so are your own notes), other than learning definitions and staring at graphs/images/tables which confuse you even more. Lectures are beyond boring. Time stops, I swear.","This is a hard class. That said, if you truly apply yourself and put in your best effort, you can get an A. Strauss is there to help you, but she will not like it if you do not care about the subject material. If you try hard, you can succeed.  Also, do not underestimate the level of detail she requires for her quizzes.","This is my favorite class I've taken all year.  I learned so much in Strauss's class and was always interested in the material. That being said, this class is not for the faint of heart. Strauss is a tough grader who expects \"graduate level\" work from her freshman students.  The high expectations are met with high reward, as you will learn so much.","Professor Strauss is the worst professor I have ever had.

She is unclear when she answers questions and her powerpoints do not make sense. If you have to take this class, you will need a good tutor. You can do well in this class as long as you work really hard and do work outside of class to understand material.","Quite possibly the worst professor I have ever had. Took Inquiries with her last year and after two semesters at Northeastern can say she is ridiculous. She thinks she helps when she only confuses you more, the quizzes are impossible (I did better when I DIDN'T study because the questions are so off topic) and she really does not know how to teach","I have actually never had a more ridiculous teacher. She does not help you in the slightest bit if you don't understand something. If you're thinking about taking her class, just don't. It's so much work just to get a mediocre grade, esp. compared to the rest of the Inquiries classes. She teaches complex graduate level info to entering freshman.","Awful.

Class is awesome!","Best professor to take algorithms course with. Really knows his subject, gives challenging assignments and puzzles in class. Multiple quizzes and exams keep you on your toes.

Very good communication skills. Rarely available for discussions outside classes. The 3-hour lectures make a great journey.","RAVI HAS SO MUCH SWAG!","Gives hard assignments, but grades on a curve. Questions are often not well-worded. Jumps into long, high-speed math or logic proofs that you don't need to know. Surprising amount of calc+algebra was required. Does give neat puzzles in class. Not bad at answering questions in class. Knowledgeable. (CS 5700 = CS 4700, it is mixed grad/undergrad.)","Told us not to buy textbook, just use his PDF notes online. Notes were riddled with mistakes. In one class he calculated the number of IPv4 addresses and confidently told us we could never run out. Ironically, he seems like an Internet junkie. This guy definitely should not teach. He should go do some research or go home and play with himself.","Grade was entirely problem sets so when you went to his office hours he refused to help at all. Sometimes explains things clearly then puts some impossible-to-follow proof on the board and loses everybody. Homework questions unrelated and much harder than info covered in class. Copy everything from the internet and you'll be fine, minus learning.","The course work for Wireless Communication was too tough and on top of that, he made my life still miserable by putting in projects! There was absolutely no help from any corner and he expects us to pull rabbits out of our hats. Although he taught some concepts clearly, the course is by no means worth taking; simply because of its difficulty level.","No Comments","The class itself wasn't bad, but the workload was obnoxious. This class was an order of magnitude harder than even the other PhD courses, and the problems sets so difficult that most students in the class put 20+ hours into EACH.

It being an online class, I was at least expecting some more feedback through email and more support, but there was none.","Professor Sieloff is tough in general. She expects you to participate (your grade depends on it) and she gives four exams, all of which were essay format. Although her assessments were tough, she did a great job of explaining the material clearly and concisely. She's an expert in the field and I would definitely take her class again.","I would take her class again if that was even possible.

I really enjoyed her class because she taught us the concepts in a very entertaining way. Loved her class even though I passed with a C+. I must warn you; the exams are really hard!","Strikingly unpleasant Professor. Shows little respect for students (often sarcastic and even confrontational). Engages class yet shoots down opinions that don't align with her own. Tests memorization rather than understanding of concepts, e.g. the 5 P's of research (Purpose, Plan, Performance, Processing, Preparation). Class exercises r unhelpful.","She is the greatest. Her class is challenging, but also not impossible to get an A. She is helpful and she genuinely cares. She incorporates fun demos into her lectures.

Certainly far from an easy A, but getting a good grade is not impossible.","She is the most condescending and spiteful professor I've ever had. She words her exam questions extremely vaguely and is a tough grader. She gives no wiggle room in homework or exams. She loves herself. a lot. and is very unwilling to answer any questions. She gives students dirty looks and is just a very rude person in general. Avoid her!","Very difficult to work with and ask questions to.  Always gets defensive even when the whole class bombs the exam, she blames us instead of the fact that she was misleading about what would be on it.

Her class was really enjoyable and she helped us out as much as possible.  When the whole group did badly on a test, she threw the test out or made it count less.  She was very fair.

Overall great class and I learned a lot, you have to READ! dont think you don't.","Prof. Simon is simply stated awesome! He makes fun engaging and fun. Definitely recommend him! If you attend and participate in class you will receive a good grade for sure!","Professor Ruff's class was what made me go for a minor in economics. There are only five non-cumulutive 40 question multiple choice exams each worth 20% of your grade. Read and understand the book chapters and if you can go to the weekly non required recitations and you will do good on tests. The practice tests on blackboard are also helpful.","Peter Simon was always engaging and tried to make economics as interesting as possible, even for non-econ majors. Go to class and sit up front to get the best experience. PARTICIPATE. It doesn't technically count for the grade, but if he knows you he totally helps you out when you need it.","The study guides he posts online are messy and unusable. The way he talks and teaches in lecture is incredibly difficult to follow unless you have attention skills of an incredible caliber. He sets his students up to fail on his ridiculous multiple choice tests.","Simon is the GEM of Econ at NEU. Take him. You'll learn and laugh.","There are only 5 tests in the whole course and they are not cumulative. They are difficult because there are only about 30 mc questions on each test, so you have to really know the material to get an A. His lectures were not very helpful I found myself mostly relying on the textbook to study, and would go to recitation before tests.","Simon's lectures are good but not helpful for the tests. You're good if you read the book and buy the Connect and do the practice multiple choice quizzes. You really have to look for it but it helps a lot for the exams. Recitation helps too. Big lecture hall. No homework or participation, your grade is made up of 5 tests. Non-cumulative final.","Great professor, inspirational lecturer, interesting person.  The tests are absolute hell. You know how you have multiple choice with several answers being nearly identical, but only one is right? Every test is that.  Blame the class, not the teach.","HE IS GOOD!","Amazing lectures! He is so concise, and explains Econ in simple terms. I thought that I wouldn't like Econ, but he made me pick up a double major in Econ. It's an easy class if you pay attention and go to recitations. He's awesome, Econ is awesome. It's a ten.","Great lectures. The entire grade is based on just 5 tests, but the lectures alone are not enough to get a good grade on the tests you also have to read the textbook.","He is a good professor but he just speaks too quickly and gives confusing analogies that by the time you start writing notes on what he says you give up really fast. Its a big lecture but he still gives you the liberty and time to ask whatever questions you might have. My best advice is to go to as many recitations as possible and read before class","Professor Simon gives fantastic lectures, but the lectures will not help you pass the tests (the entire grade is based on 5 tests).In order to pass the tests, READ THE BOOK and make sure you can adequately answer every question at the end of each chapter. A student could conceivably earn an A in this class without attending a single lecture.","5 tests in the semester including the final, each worth 20% of the grade and none are cumulative. Sounds so much easier than it is. Professor Simon is a great guy but the tests are worded so poorly and he never gives any feedback. Ever. Once I took my test I never saw it again, only the grade on blackboard. Very Frustrating.","I liked the professor, but I found that some of the lectures a bit pointless. He was always interesting, but a lot of the content we went through in the lectures never were on the tests. I didn't read the text book and this was my major flaw. READ THE TEXT BOOK. His questions are worded in a weird way which I didn't like, but you get used to it.","Professor Simon is passionate and clearly knows what he's talking about. Tests are hard, so you need to study a lot. He is nice, and lectures are fun. No extra credit. Grade based on multiple choice tests","Your whole grade will be based off 5 multiple choice tests (20% each). Doesn't give any homework, but you should definitely read the chapters because the tests are heavily based on the reading. Easy class to do well in so long as you do the basic reading and show up to his lectures (he is hilarious and entertaining).","Peter Simon has a passion for economics, a passion for students, and a passion for teaching. He sprinkles humor (its good, too!) throughout the lectures that makes you WANT to go to class, even if it's just for his jokes. He is great at what he does.

Her lecture outlines are so helpful and write word to word of what she says. Tests are easy as well!","Shes really nice&funny.

You must attend lectures if you want to pass the tests at all since all the tests are based directly off the notes from lectures.","Lectures were way too long considering Prof Spikes just reads off of a lecture outline. If you ask a question she'll reword your question for an answer. Doesn't use power points, and the humor gets really old and distracting.

She's a very entertaining person, but the class lacked depth and inspiration. She would hand us all of the information and explain things with silly examples...  And yet I couldn't expect an A because the quizzes were so poorly worded!  Really dampened my interest in psychology.","Come to class and take notes, because the tests are based on lectures.  She is entertaining and funny, and her information is pretty straight forward.  However, I felt that the class lacked depth; that dampened my interest in psychology.  Also, the poor wording on the quizzes made it difficult for me to predict my grade despite studying well.","As long as you come to class every day and pay attention, you'll get an A. She provides lecture notes for each class, where you just fill out everything while she's talking. For the exam, she tells you exactly what will be on the exam and what specific numbers and figures you need to know. Professor Spikes is super enthusiastic and friendly as well","Easy class. Really interesting. She makes it fun. For the exams you just need to study what she tells you to study and you'll be fine.","Spikes tries to be funny and make the class laugh rather than actually teaching. She relies on the lecture outlines completely. I missed a quiz because I couldn't get back into the city after the bombing and she refused to let me make it up and gave me a zero unless I came back in the summer to take it. Easy if you do it exactly her way.","Had her for developmental (honors) and social. both classes are easy and have no finals. prof. spikes is also really funny. not exactly the best teacher ever, but she provides lecture outlines that are very relevant to the tests","Easiest class of all time.

However, if you actually analyze her lecture style, you will realize that she is simply trying to be funny, and not exactly aiming to foster real learning.

Easily intimidated, highly unread on the subject, degrading in her teaching & boring. She plagiarizes the entire course from the book. If you want an easy A & don't mind paying 4k for what is a true insult & disgrace to proper learning, you'll fit right in. For anyone here that seeks the slightest challenge, look elsewhere","Prof. Spikes is awesome! She is really helpful and makes the class really interesting. You'll get good grades as long as you go to class, read what she tells you to and review your notes/attend the review session.  HIGHLY recommend.","I received an A in this class, but it was no thanks to Spikes. Plainly put, she is a complete lunatic. Its almost like she hates her students and she treats them like they are worthless. She is just rude and completely unhelpful. I would not take her again.","Professor Spikes is awesome!

However, if you make the effort to see him outside of class and work hard at it, you can do much better.  Slightly inconvenient that I had to go to office hours at least once a week but was able to do well in the class. Make sure you show up to all classes!","Learned absolutely nothing in lectures. Everything I learned in this class I had to re-teach myself outside of it. Has a bad accent, but the problem is really how he mumbles and talks quietly. Notes are not linear, so don't look away. Hardly partial credit on tests because they are out of 10... so even -1 screws you. I would avoid this professor.","This was a great class (Prob/Stat) and Shah was a great teacher.  He is very smart and helps you understand the material very well.  He does make some mistakes at the board sometimes but its never in method, usually just arithmetic.  A good guy with a good attitude.","You can't understand what he is saying, he doesn't understand what you ask and therefore answers with something completly unrelated... oh, and EVERYONE in his class failed the final... what was up with that&#63;hw seems ike a nice guy tho, just not good at teaching :(","No Comments","he's very helpful when you attend his office hours. he's approachable which is tough to find in a math prof; there are a lot of math profs who just aren't approachable AT ALL. he knows what he's doing and he sometimes goes really fast. i used to dread multivariable calc but he makes it doable; he takes away the fear factor.","He may be hard to understand (he basically talks like Milton from Office Space), but he is definitely a good hearted guy and is dedicated to helping people understand the material. He does ramble on needlessly sometimes, but his classes combined with recitation aren't that bad. Sit close to him though, it's hard to hear him a lot.","This guy is really bad. He has a terrible accent, so understanding him is difficult, then he explains stuff very poorly. Sometimes he rushes through stuff. When you get to sequences and series, good luck -- he's terrible at explaining it even though its the majority of the course. The first week will suck because he does no calc 1 review.","No Comments","I found the class relatively easy, although I had some prior experience. The quizes are based off of problems he covers over and over again, sometimes verbatim. Some other students find his explanations hard to follow, but my rebuttle is that he is available for extra help during office hours.","Worst teacher I've ever had in my entire life. Aweful at explaining things and answering questions. Does not give partial credit. Good luck if you ever have this man for a teacher.","If you pay attention in class and do all your hwk, you will do fine because his quizzes are based on most of the examples he give in class. Sometimes the questions on the quiz are the exact questions off the book. Very boring. Hates it when students talk amongst themselves and interrupt the class!","Class is pretty easy considering I don't go, does not follow the syllabus, if you don't know Calc, then go, will use a lot of in class examples for tests and quizzes"],"courses":["MATH1342","MATH2331","MATH2331","MATH2331","MATH1342","MATH1342","MATH1342","MTH342","MTHU481","MTH481","MTHU341","MTHU342","MTH341","MTH341","CALC2","CALC2","CALC2","MTHU142","MTH141","MTH141"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","POOR","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","POOR","POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","GOOD","POOR","AWFUL","GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}},{"name":"Shahood, Tom","id":"000070801","email":"t.shahood@northeastern.edu","primaryappointment":"Lecturer","primarydepartment":"College of Professional Studies","firstName":"Tom","lastname":"Shahood","rmp":{}},{"name":"Shannon, Jacqueline","id":"000557869","email":"ja.shannon@northeastern.edu","primaryappointment":"Lecturer","primarydepartment":"College of Professional Studies","firstName":"Jacqueline","lastname":"Shannon","rmp":{}},{"name":"Shansky, Rebecca","id":"001134519","phone":"6173737750","email":"r.shansky@northeastern.edu","primaryappointment":"Assistant Professor","primarydepartment":"Psychology","firstName":"Rebecca","lastname":"Shansky","rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1751655","fname":"Rebecca","lname":"Shansky","quality":"3.6","easiness":"4.3","help":"4.3","clarity":"4.3","topTag":"Tough Grader (3)","grade":"4.3","university":"Northeastern University","chili":"cold","tags":["GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","AMAZING LECTURES"],"comments":["Pr.

I hate that the materials haven't been put together by a single resource but the professor was smart, a little nutty but super excited about the material.","This class has really ruined my semester. I was intrigued by the course description, but the actual material we study and the breadth of random details we are expected to regurgitate is astounding. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! A great deal of the material consists of unorganized findings from research on rodents in highly specific experiments.","Judging from how this course runs, it seems apparent that this should just be an online course. Dr. Shansky records all her lectures on Tegrity anyway. So if you do not come to class, you can just catch the lecture on Tegrity- just attend the class meetings when there is a quiz or exam. No real benefit in coming to class, which is terrible.","The course name needs to be changed from “Neuropsychology of Fear” to “Neuroscience of Fear.” I know the course name is just a name, however it should still attempt to accurately represent the course content in a nutshell.

I like how he incorporates something interesting like a popular TV show and makes it relatable to our topics. However you really really need to pay attention to what he says because his tests are SO HARD! They are open book but trust me that doesn't matter if you don't understand what he says in class! Otherwise he's an amazing teacher, funny, helpful, knowledgeable, kind and ready to hear what everyone has to say with full interest and acceptance. Great guy, must take his class.","For someone who is only minoring in psych, I was looking for an easy, fun class to fulfill my requirements. This class was EXACTLY what I was looking for. If you pay attention in class, and take decent notes, you will do great on the tests (which are online & open note). DEFINITELY would recommend,  you will learn a lot, this guy knows how to teach","Don't listen to any negative reviews about Dr. Sharp. I am serious. Not only is he a great lecturer but he incorporates a lot of extras to make a lecture more fun and interesting. He uses the TopHat app so you're able to participate that way, he relates the psychology topics discussed to pop culture and you get to watch TV! He is amazing.","He's very nice, but the class is high school amateurish (tweeting, watching Modern Family for homework, useless clicker questions, etc). Also, the psychoanalytic focus was a little off-putting. Definitely the least 'sciency' psychology class I've ever taken. If you want to believe that dreams have hidden meaning, he's your guy.","I should have done better in this class considering how easy he makes it, but I got caught by some stupid mistakes about when things were due. (Completely my fault). He's an amazing teacher, he's passionate about the class, and has insightful lectures. Existentialism was my personal favorite unit.","Dr. Sharp is a great prof and lecturer. Only 3 journal entries based on Modern Family episodes, 3 quizzes (online) and 3 exams (also online!). Pretty easy to get an A if you try. Participation is very encouraged.","I absolutely loved Professor Sharp. His tests are actually pretty difficult, but his class it totally worth taking. He's such a great guy and great professor. I would highly recommend visiting him during his office hours. He's a clinical psychologist so he'll ask you about your life and just let you talk about whatever with him.","It's funny, I now go back and see all these comments about how he changed people's lives. That's exactly what he did for me, too. By far the most influential professor I have ever taken, and entirely changed the way I thought and lived. He makes you conscious; he challenges you to be self-aware. Take him while you still can.","Best teacher I ever had, went back and had him for multiple classes. He changed my life!","Best Professor ever!!! Makes a three and a half hour seminar at 8am worth it!!!","The best professor I have had to Northeastern. Listen in class and you'll be fine. All tests are online. Very interesting as he relates his class to his work as a praticing psychologist.","Best professor in all my college years. Took personality and seminar in clinical psych with him. Fascinating man, learned so much from him!","Favorite professor EVER. Classes were interesting and funny, as well as engaging and thoughtful. Really felt like I learned the most from Dr. Sharps classes. I recommend taking any class you can with him","Best professor I've ever had!

Perfect balance of lecture, media, and homework where I learned a great deal but it was fun the whole time. He has great stories about his career as a psychoanalyst.  He was approachable, fair, and very clear.  I am enrolling in his seminar because I learned so much in Personality.","Never on time and all over the place. He is not worth the cost to take a class at this school. I learned nothing. He creates online tests that malfunction. One time everyone got a 35% no matter how well they knew the information. Frustrating. He is a nice guy- but he phones it in.","My FAVORITE professor in all my time at Northeastern. He explained the material and I learned more in his class about psychology than all the other psych classes I have taken combined.

But if you do really well, you'll get an A-. Besides that, he is an amazing teacher. Very kind, leads his class with discussions so you never get bored (instead of the usual lectures). However, be prepared for LOTS of homework. I personally love him.","Shimer led my American Gov class in a kind of open debate, back and forth type way. Each class someone acted as the \"moderator\" whod call on people. Loved that it became a class where open debate could go on and although we got off topic at times, it always led to something else that was just as fun talking about. Easy grader, little work, lenient","Assigns a lot of homework early on and has the class lead the discussion. He wouldn't be a bad professor if his grading policies weren't so strict. It's been 1 month and nobody has a grade about a B.","Awesome teacher, randomly picks people to lead a discussion, which got the class to be involved and actually read. I looked forward to class everyday! He didn't lecture much and had discussions with the professor instead of tests! If you asked him a question he would go out of his way to help you. I would HIGHLY recommend him for any class.","Professor Shimer is a really smart guy.  He can take an engineer who has never taken a political science course and create a well versed foundation of government/politics/law.  Easy to follow/listen to.  Gets students involved.  One of the few classes where the professor got the students to think...","The entire class is based around a massive group project. If you work well with and like your group, it will be really fun. Only two/three tests that if you study the terms well, you will do fine. He's very laid back, but attendance and participation are very important. Overall its a good class and he's a good guy.","Shimer is a great teacher! He has such interesting life stories that keep the class interesting. Just make sure to keep up with the textbook because tests are department-wide so its solely based off that. Also, go to his office hours for help with the business plan, he will stay late and will never leave you confused! Love Shimer definitely reccom","does not explain anything at all, but he uploads all the materials on blackboard site and expects you to read it all, all the homework submissions are done online. he does not give too much homework though. he helps with the business plans","Never expect him much as a teacher  Study the assigned section of the textbook yourself because he does not teach anything besides common on the group business plan He is always willing to help Because he does not teach anything at all  Make sure to read the textbook  Nice guy but useless teacher  Do what he tell u to do for the business plan","Shimer is such a kind man who will truly help you out so long as you participate and show interest in the class.  Not a difficult class at all if you show up, pay attention, and show some effort. Definitely one of the easier Intro to Business professors from what I have heard from other students.","Shimer is a really nice guy! He does teach straight from the PowerPoints but if you pay attention, you will get something good out of his class. He is also very approachable and I'm sure he'd be willing to do everything he could to help a student out.","Shimer is a decent professor. In class he is a nice guy, but over e-mail he tries to be all tough! He will help along the way with the TJX business plan and wants to see his students do well. Tests are very simple and definitions are right out of the book. Compared to some of the other professors who teach Sustaining, he is probably one of the best","Easy. Don't really have to pay too much attention in class. Just make sure that you speak up in the first couple of classes and he'll love you. He'll tell you exactly what to do on all the tests during the reviews. Good guy. Genuine. Helpful enough on the TJX Project.","Cool guy, very easy class. Talks alot about random stuff like his previous life but its mostly relevant. Tests are easy but he is a tough grader because he wants it exactly his way. Homework is a joke, and participation is extremely easy. He is also very approachable if you need anything, he wants to see you succeed. Overall easy B+/A- class.","Really enjoyed Prof. Shimer. Be prepared to hear a lot about his wine of the month business. Very nice teacher. I did not do so well on the TJX business plan but I was one of the few people who attended every class and in a class of 20 students Shimer really notices. If you want a nice easy going guy this is the one.","Shimer tries to be a chill guy. The class itself is the same across all professors, but Shimer kind of sucks at explaining things.

Amazing life stories, absolutely brilliant guy. Go as far out of your way as possible to take a course with him. The Y combinator lecture (the last one of the semester) is a memory that will stick with me forever.","Shivers is incredible professor.

One of my better professors.","he's the best","very helpful and the class was interesting. class was relatively easy to keep up with, though not being able to use a computer in class sometimes made it difficult to keep track of code. the course does not always follow the book, but exams and homework assume you're caught up in the reading. try not to fall behind in that, it's hard to catch up.","Olin is a great teacher. He is superb at communicating new ideas and topics.","Olin is the coolest guy that you will meet during your time at Northeastern.","Olin is a really awesome teacher! he really cares about his students and doesn't judge if you don't understand something. On the other hand, he runs the class at a pretty fast pace and if you miss class you will probably get really behind.","The bomb","Fantastic Teacher. Makes you want to be a better student, really inspires the desire to be a great programmer. I highly recommend taking his Fundamentals class.","Has favorites. If you go to his office hours he acts like he can't be bothered.  Never responds to email.  On the plus side, his lectures are funny.","This guy is by far my favorite professor so far. I knew nothing of programming before coming in and he taught me a lot. No **** added either, straight how it is. Incredible. Ask him about his time in grad school for an eye opener.","Very, very interesting person. He's somewhat intimidating, and has this big thing about participating in class and getting noticed. However, the class has a real &quot;roof&quot; as to how well you can possibly perform. Not a hard class if youre cut out for CS. Class was very informative, and both exams (60% of grade) were easy.

Also, he has excellent and entertaining rants.","Crazy class, You get out of it what you put in, and most will try to put in as much as posible.

Granted, it was my first college semester but I felt that whenever I asked for an explanation, I was more confused afterward. And her TA was NOT helpful.

No matter whether I spend days  of study or whether I don't study at all, I always receive the a score in the same range!","If you are good at memorization you will be fine.

You can easily miss the class and just use your textbook and the outlines but it's a lot of reading and memorization. Not friendly at all if you ask for help.","Very easy! Gives printed outlines, just fill in as she lectures (so don't miss class). Outlines are easy to follow and informative. I didn't buy or use a textbook once.

She said a lot of personal stories, supposedly to help understand concepts but it's debatable if they were actually helpful. Of course though this is my biased opinion. I was miserable but at least it helped me decide to change my major lol.","Nancy is by far the worst professor I have had at NU.

Very helpful and provides sufficient feedback. One of few professors who really respects students. Makes classes entertaining. Definitely recommend him. Don't skip too much !","I took Interpreting the Day's News and J3 with Professor Schroeder, and wish I could take a third course with him too. He makes the class time go by so quickly. The lectures are interesting and funny, using lots of visuals and news clips, with a ton of class discussion. The workload is reasonable. And as an added bonusno textbooks!","Good professor, difficult to keep working on your papers sometimes, but he doesn't grade too hard. Keep watching the news, becuase you'll have news quizzes, although you'll know they're coming. You have 4 2-3 page papers, one 6 page paper as a midterm and an essay final exam, a lot of writing, but a lot of fun.","The best professor I've had in two years at NEU. Knows what he's talking about, really funny personality, understanding and open-minded. I really looked forward to this class!

He is really nice and the news is always interesting, hence, the class is very interesting.  He was also excellent at teaching journalistic material and kept our attention by covering stories that interested us.  I HIGHLY recommend the class.","Schroeder was a GREAT professor.  J3 has a hard reputation, but for Summer II classes he took in the circumstances and was really lenient.  Extremely engaging and keeps you interested with sarcasm and comments about pop culture, which are always appreciated in my book.","hes the best prof ive had at neu. two years later, i still go to him for help. take all of his classes!","Schroeder is the coolest professor in the journalism department. I took J3 and TV Newswriting from him. He is funny, a good teacher and enjoys interacting with students. Even helped me out after I was done with his classes.","Great prof!","Fun class, good guy. Always slightly inappropriate, always hilarious.","What can I say that hasn't already been said&#63;  He's a very fun and interesting lecturer who has great TV experience to fall back on.  Also doesn't hurt that he doesn't give much outside work and gives pretty easy quizzes.  Try to really get into his classes, professors like Schroeder are hard to find.","On the first day of class, Schroeder was talking about how he wanted a mint julep - pretty much set the course for the rest of the semester. He is an easy grader, very open and definitely engaging. You will not regret taking one of his classes.","Excellent professor.  Made class enjoyable to go to and made a subject I wasn't necessarily interested in fascinating.  Overall a joy to have.","He is a great teacher and actually keeps you awake in class. You learn a lot in JRN 3 and it is a nice change from the cut and dry news writing. He also is super helpful and is always willing to talk to you even a year after you take his class. Really cares about his students and teaching.","Great Professor! I highly reccomend him for Interpreting the days news","great teacher, loved him, funny and interesting- AND he knows his stuff","Good guy. This class is so easy.

He post powerepoints with only titles for students to take notes. If you don't go to class, he won't give out complete version of powerpoints.

Just make sure you study at least 3-5 days before a test as there is a lot of information.

I took him for COMM 1131 and the class is not difficult, however,  you really need to study using both the text book and his lecture notes.  If  you miss his class you will not pass the course and relying  solely on the lecture notes will not get you an A in the class.","I really am enjoying this class. It is my biggest class, but I don't feel too much like a little fish in a big pond. The only thing is that during his lectures he is always slapping his thighs. When I caught on it was very distracting. He doesn't give homework which tells you that you need to study or you will not pass. And don't get the text book.","His lectures are entertaining and if you go to class then you really don't need the textbook. Tests are simple, but a bit tricky. Other than that, I really enjoyed him as a Professor.","Joe Shcwartz is possibly the worst teacher. Have taken 4 classes and he's very irritating!!!!!!!!DO NOT take a class with him.","Joe Schwartz is super entertaining and totally hot. He makes research methods fun with his examples and persona. If you are paying attention in class and show respect, you will like him. Try to make him smile.","Definitely a hottie if you swing that way... really great professor though. Cares a lot about his students and can really help students improve on the dreaded task that is public speaking.","If teacher does not like you forget it! He makes you feel extremely uncomfortable even when you try to reach out to. Does not give second chances to hand it or rewrite a paper. Classes were pretty dull-responds to email late and is harsh. Do not recommend.","He was awesome, so passionate and fun. All of the quiz and test questions came from slideshow notes, so as long as you copy that down or study from those you should be fine.","I had this professor twice. He is extremely nice and a great guy. He makes class interesting and fun. All the questions on his tests are straight from his notes, you don't have to so the readings. I would definitely recommend a class with him.","Great professor. I wish I could take him a few more times because he is so helpful with everything.

I had public speaking with him this past semester and although the material for that class is repetitive and boring, he found ways to make it interesting.

Shes very energetic about what she teaches.  She presents a lot of material, but its bearable since there are little breaks in between her lectures that test for comprehension.  Shes knows her tests are hard, but they aren't impossible either once you get the hang of them. Highly recommended!","Wendy is always in a good mood and very nice and happy.

There is a lot of material, but sometimes she even allows notecards.  A fascinating course, I think all bio majors should take this!  Wendy is one of the best at NU!","Excellent class.

Almost everyone in this course had taken courses from him before. I'll take another from him again if I can.","Very helpful, explained everything very well. I enjoyed everyone of his classes.

He's not an easy A, but fair. It's fun to talk with him both in and out of class. All in all, a great teacher.","A great course and a great prof. This prof knows a lot; enough to know not to be full of himself and to treat his students as adults and as friends. His text analysis is unreal, yet he conveys his incites really clearly.","DeAngelis is a pro. Knows his stuff and knows how to present it. A sixty-something with more life than a thirty-something. Friendly, funny, interesting to talk to. Best philosophy prof I've had.","Took this section of Intro Philosophy not knowing what to expect. It was great. Prof DeAngelis was terrific at stimulating, useful classroom discussions and his essay assignments were creative. I will definitely take a class from him again. Starting this fall he'll be semi-retired, teaching only one class per term. Too bad, he's a great teacher.","Prof Deangelis is fantastic.

Can't say enough","I have been lucky to have DeAngelis for Logic, Modern Phil and this Wittgenstein Seminar. The readings for this course were almost impossibbly difficult, but DeAngelis managed to make it understandable. I've never seen him so focused or determined. Still he established the same rapport with his class that we've come to expect and appreciate of him.","Besides being a GENIUS, he is a wonderful, lovable professor who is never afraid to take the class above and beyond what any other teacher would do. His insights into the texts are amazing and he has a way of showing the class his thought process, helping us understand his way of thinking. AND He DOES NOT force you to accept his interpretation!","This was a very hard course. The teachers many useful handouts simplified things and helped the class through some of the worst. He was always very well prepared. His rapport with the class was about the best I have ever experienced. The class was fun despite being difficult. DeAngelis is top notch.","DeAngelis is the best. He manages to entertain as well as teach, but he isn't easy. His tests and his grading are fair. He is really helpful. Take logic from HIM!","DeAngelis's ratings stress his personality and clarity as positives. I agree. I am surprised that none of them mention that he is brilliant. Course readings from Voltaire, Tolstoy, Dostoevski, and Vonnegut. Hard! DeAngelis showed the philosophy in them through class activities and challenging assignments. Another plus: Many cute female students!","I took Modern Philosophy to meet a core requirement. The Philosophy Majors loved DeAngelis. I could see why. He really explained things well and was easy to deal with and fair-minded. I wish I liked the course more, but he did a gereat job getting me involved.","Prof DeAngeles made a dry subject (Logic) come to life. He was very good at explaining difficult concepts.

He teaches in a very unconventional way but that's what makes the class so awesome, because it forces you to think. If you participate a lot and are genuinely interested in the class then you will do well.","Dugan was absolutely amazing. He pushes students to think outside of the box, and to explore ways of thinking that they otherwise probably wouldn't. Considered switching my major to Phil after taking this class. Advice: raise your hand! It doesn't matter if you 'don't know the answer' (ps in PHIL there isnt one), he just wants your opinion!! 10/10!","All I can say is wow.  Existentialism has been the most intellectually challenging course I think I will ever take, and Dugan is absolutely brilliant.  Everybody complains about the participation, but that's the point - ask your own questions.  No quizzes, no tests, just read the book and discuss.  Highly recommended, you'll enjoy every lecture.","never tells you your grade until last day of class.... dont take him","Ask lots of questions if you're trying to get a midterm grade, but you really grade yourself at the end of the term.","A large part of your final grade will be participation. He should realize that some students are just not built to freely express their ideas in the class.","Very impressed by his teaching... love how you see the world from a different point of view after his class","Dugan is exactly what a professor is meant to be. He teaches using the socratic method, and is very good at it. He is exceedingly intelligent and loves to share this knowledge. I took EX 1 and 2 with him and will never be the same. he brings out the best in you and you will truly love him by the end of the semester","I'm a philosophy major who's taken 3 courses with Dugan and enjoyed them. He's very good. My one reservation is that he has develped a following - some very smart, some less so. Dugan favors them and is tough on anyone who argues with him. Even lame remarks from his followers slide by while better comments from others are dismissed or ridiculed.","Well I have been acquainted with Prof. Dugan for years, and taken many of his classes, and once again my life has been changed for the better!  This professor is one of the most genuine instructors that I have ever worked for - a man who cares about knowledge over the appearance of grades.  A+ professor with A+ classes!","I'm torn on Dugan. He seems like a great guy, he evokes very interesting and useful class discussion, and he makes very thorough comments on papers. But he needs to put grades on those papers. And he needs to realize that students can do good work without participating all the time. Overall, it's worth it to take him.","Changed my life...again!! This class was extremely challenging, you have read with a lot of depth, and mostly reread the material. But what you get out of every class you take with dugan is an illumination that will light the rest of your life. This education is not typical it is internal and eternal. I recommend dugan 100%.","Tough to evaluate. Dugan is unique in some very good ways and not so good ways. He is a very energetic teacher, really intense, and that inspires quite a few students. He can also put students on the spot in class in ways that border on cruelty. He brought one student close to tears. In almost every other respect he is a well above average Prof.","The best professor at Northeastern. Changed my life by explaining that philosophy is personal. Made me question all the social norms and our ways of behavior. Dugan FTW!!!!!!","By far the best professor I have ever had. Completely blew my mind with the ideas he presented, and his class (Existentialism) is the only one that has really stuck with me and changed the way I live my life, five years after I took it... Amazing professor.","This class is not technically difficult but he challenges everyone in the class to discuss and analyze complex issues. I did not like it at first, I found him intimidating but once I got used to the class format I really got a lot out of it.","Idealistic to the point of alienation (its philosophy). He has many cute ideas on his perfect world, but when you try to point out to him in class discussion that they are unrealistic and unfeasible, he will quickly quiet you and move on. Very poor at discussing both sides of an issue. Hes either a poor mediator or the avatar of philosophy, or both","So awesome, turns conventional teaching on its ear. Total disregard for grades and anything else like that. I literally had NO idea what grade I had for the year until I got my report card. Too bad i spent the year stressing about my grade when I should have sat back and enjoyed. I would take it again.","Technology and Human Values was a wonderful class. Professor Dugan is great.  His lectures are engaging and frightening.  Your grade is composed of one project, a take home final and class participation.","Participate! That's all you need to get a good grade, even if you dont get what is being said, or you dont agree, just speak up. Do some of the reading so you know what everyone is talking about. 2 papers and a final, not too bad of a grader. Not that it matters, he asks you on the final what you should get-- just JUSTIFY IT!!

In sum, take someone else","She is so great. I took physics 1 for engineering with her and made it so simple, because she is very organize.

It's not her fault the lecture/ILS structure doesn't work.","The material is not the hardest but she cannot explain any of the concepts and she provides no examples, she makes the class more difficult than it has to be.

He goes through material super fast and at times it's hard to keep up, but he cares about his classes and makes them light-hearted and as fun as an accounting class can be. A lot of group time during class to work on problems, fairly minimal lecture.","Prof Dinan is pretty great at teaching, just go to class and participate as much as you can, as long as you do the connect assignments and pay attention in class, getting an A won't be hard. He covers all the material in class and also gives many hints, if you're not good at financial accounting, take his class, you won't regret it","Prof Dinan is sarcastic and funny. Don't skip class - he makes sure to focus on relevant, important content. Homework isn't hard to keep up with (10 Connect assignments total + 2 group case studies) but you need to remember the due dates. He does freely give extensions for them. Tests are tough!!

He knows accounting really well and can break it down in a way that makes it seem simple even for students who tend to struggle with accounting.  He is very funny and can make the most boring topics funny.  He is so efficient that class usually ends 15-20 minutes early.  Definitely take him!","It was the class forced to be taken but with this professor, I was even thinking adding this concentration. Funny and easy keeps us engage. Love to ask questions. Always thinking the question from our standing point, grades specifically. Currently the best professor that I have ever met in NEU. Recommending this prof to everyone around me.","This will be the greatest professor you will ever have. Ever. His teaching style makes you interested in the boring materials, he's always there to hear you out and give advice, and he's simply hilarious.","Amazing professor, inspired me to declare accounting as my concentration. He really cares about what information is important in the real world and skips things that you would never see. He knows its an easy subject and doesn't go out of his way to make it more complicated than it needs to be. Would love to take him again for other classes.","he is very easy going, and makes the class easy to follow by only focusing in important facts and going through hard problems in class (similar to the ones you will find in the exam). He is a very nice guy. take this professor if you are taking any accounting course","Dinan does an amazing job of teaching what would otherwise be a boring class. He skips the unnecessary parts of powerpoints and makes sure to go through example problems with the whole class. Even though about 13 of our lectures were cancelled from snow days, he still thoroughly prepared us for the unchanged department final.","This class is designed to be the entry-level class for both Accounting and Finance. Dinan is a great teacher and really does engage the students and is enthusiastic about teaching. Although the multiple choice on the test are a bit difficult, if you study the problems he gives you in class, the problems on the test will be very straightforward.","I do NOT recommend this teacher. He's a really funfunny guy, but he never gets his powerpoints done in class. His TA grades all of his tests and if you want any grades changed, you have to take it up with the TA, who (in my case) got super defensive and wouldn't change the grades. He also never explains anything properly no matter what you ask.","Dinan is great! I preferred financial accounting to this managerial acct class but he helps a lot and is funny. Doesn't take anything to serious and definitely an interesting guy with a lot of industry experience. Be prepared to study for exams, its not necessarily an easy A class if your not a big acct fan.. ;)","So hard and not helpful at all if you dont understand","Best class!","Dinan is a man among boys, and a God among men.

Had him last semester and he's easily one of my favorite professors. Wish I could take a course with him again, he's a great person. Lectures can derail a bit as he likes to go off on tangents often, but he'll get across the information you need to know and then some. Fantastic professor!","Very enthusiastic about film, which is awesome, but can go on tangents forever. Exams are pretty straightforward and his assignments are graded decently hard but he is a good teacher. I recommend him but be prepared for long classes (3 hours)","Great guy, very inspiring. He gives readings but the most important thing is to attend the classes, listen to his lectures and write notes down which will be essential for the papers and exams.","Film Analysis class: The guy was extremely passionate about his subject, he could talk for hours which sometimes made him run short of time. We didn't have many discussions either. He likes to chat with students before or after class so go ahead and start a conversation about an awesome movie you've watched recently. He prepares study guides too.","Professor Dow is definitely a great teacher. Even though he goes off on tangents it's very obvious that he is passionate about what he teaches. His analytical skills are superb and I certainly learned a lot during the course.","You should definitely take a class with Dow, for your major or for an elective. As a cinema studies major, there isn't a professor more excited and analytical. As an elective, he grades fairly, screens interesting movies, and keeps his lectures energetic. If he sees excitement about movies in a student, he can talk for hours. Definitely worth it.","Michael is my favorite professor throughout my three semesters in Northeastern. For students taking for elective, You will get a new insight of watching film throughout rest of your life, and it's worth it. For ones taking it for understanding basic cinema,  you will know all the basic concept of language of cinema by his way, and remember it.","I'm a physics major who only took film analysis to fill my art req. I actually got a lot more out of this class than I expected. Prof Dow is pretty much the man. He gets really excited about film and goes on tangents all the time. Really knows what he's talking about and a really nice dude.","I had to take this class for humanities and was completely blown away.  Dow knows his stuff, inside and out, to the point where he'll run off on topics cause he gets so excited about aspects of cinema...his passion is evident.  Really helpful and accommodating outside problems.  Great movies, great class.","Michael Dow is, quite simply, one of the best professors I've had in any subject. I took this class as an elective because of my growing interest in film and I've emerged with so much knowledge on the subject. As long as you go to class and take notes, you can't go wrong. You watch plenty of great films and he grades very fairly. And he's funny!","He is the best cinema professor at the school. He knows a ton and is never boring. That being said, you better like taking notes... lots of notes :)","Definitely take a course with Dow. He screens really cool movies, even if you haven't even heard of them. His lectures are interesting and there is two tests and two papers. No final.","Prof Dow definitely knows his stuff. He teaches a lot of theory relative to film that is occasionally difficult to comprehend, but he is an excellent teacher for Majors and Electives. Definitely keep watch for his classes, they're well worth taking.","Great professor who definitely knows his stuff about film. Two days a week, watch a movie one, lecture on the other.

I'm sure he's very smart however, his English skills limit his ability to communicate clearly. His claim to teach you material beyond the book is basically BS.  His textbook is poorly worded, organized, and is very unhelpful. I had to use many other resources to learn.","Took this class last year. I dont know what everyone was ranting on about computers, pretty much everyone has one. And its just as easy to do it on the calc or manually. Lets you know what types of questions will be on the exam and will go over sample Qs. Tests are fair. The final is a make up of one the previous tests. He has some funny stories.","Nice guy.  Easy class if you have a laptop since you can use it for quizes.   He likes going off topic a bit to talk about how people use stats in the real world, but it's more interesting than reading from a book.","He is a VERY great teacer. If you show up to every class, sit up front, and do all your work, you'll be fine. i started off with like a grade below an F, maybe even worse. But i got a C+ at the end of the term. and that was because i showed up and did my work. he's very nice. Go to office hours, it helps!","Pr. Dadkhah unfairly is tagged as a bad teacher. He is anything but. He wants you to learn on your own in order to develop a command of the material, not just memorize the technique used so you can get an A on the test. He only &quot;sinks the boat&quot; if you're looking for a handout and can't take responsibility for you're own education. Good teacher!!!","It's hard to rate Professor Dadkhah.  He's a nice guy, but a terrible teacher.  Everything I learned was from doing the homework assignments.  He teaches Statistics using Excel and lets you use your laptop on the tests.  If you don't have a laptop, you better know how to use your calculator well.  4 tests, no midterm, the final is used as a makeup.","Really good teachers raise the boat for everyone. Mediocre teachers don't do anything at all.  Really bad teachers, sink the boat for everyone.  Not only did this teacher sink the boat, but he also abandoned ship.  He didn't help people understand, didn't prepare for class and his textbook was a disaster.  One good thing - he's sometimes funny.","absolutely the worst professor ever.

I feared her and that really hindered my experience to actually learn. I do not recommend it. The the topic did sound interesting, she just ruined it.","Her class was a chore. She talks like her class is the most important thing in the world, and that we should be happy to spend endless hours outside of class writing endless papers, which she then grades as \"repetitive\". You can never please her and she will find reasons to grade you down.","Dallimore creates a hostile environment and belittles students to no end. You learn a lot but it's not worth the time and energy to take her course. Kiss your social life and sanity goodbye if you have a class with this woman. HORRIBLE.","She is a harsh grader and she makes the class way too hard. It's an introduction class but might as well be a writing intensive class. She expects you to put SOO much time out of class and makes you participate A LOT. You really don't know your grade until the moment you check the report at the end of the semester! Do not recommend.","For an introduction course it is way to hard and she is the harshest grader ever. If you do choose to do this class, it will definitely be your hardest class and you will have to put SO much time out of class.","Incredibly condescending to students. Has unreasonable expectations for students and does not teach this class like an intro class. Highly recommend avoiding this class.","She is a very unnecessarily hard grader for an intro class, so expect to read a lot and to participate A LOT. I personally did not enjoy her class and most people in my class would agree with me.","Best Professor I have ever had, period!","Ridiculous woman- she's the most rigid and ridiculous person I've ever met. She assumes that you have no other classes, friends, family, or general hours in the day that do not revolve around her class. She's so rigid, don't ever expect her to be reasonable or understanding what you go to meet her. Oh, and she's obsessed with herself. DO NOT TAKE!!","Best class I've ever taken. She's clear about her expectations and flexible about due-dates. She goes over everything and is always willing to help outside of class. Heavy workload, but it's a writing intensive course so you should expect it. Slackers beware. I learned more in this class than any other I've taken. It IS possible to get an A. I did.","She is by far the most ridiculous woman that I've ever met. Not only is she conceited (class wise) but she pretends as if her classes were this hard when she was in school (highly untrue).

One of the hardest most time consuming classes i have ever taken but one of the best. Learned alot and took alot out of it. Dallimore is an impossible grader, but an amazing professor. Highly recommend taking her classes, but not at the same time as another hard class.","Really hard grader but not impossible. The class is interesting and attendance is not mandatory but if you don't go you're screwed. You have to do the reading because she gives pop quizzes plus grades you daily on class participation. A really big workload so don't take another really hard class at the same time. Overall I think she's a good teache","Students who are critical are probably students who didn't do the work.

However, very intense- talks loud, LOVES morning, talks close to your face etc. Also likes to elaborate on everything twenty times, and asks you to do the same.

Participation is a big chunk of the grade, and attendance is mandatory. The tests cover a lot of content, so make sure to start earlier. Moderately high amount of reading. He's a great lecturer and classes were interesting!","Prof Dau is good and is passionate about Int'l Business but most of the class is just powerpoint and he conducts stupid debates that go over the same assignment that you wrote last night. Tests are mostly multiple choice and right off the chapter summary but sometimes get super specific. Constant assignments but he gives a 100% easily on those.","His tests are no longer multiple choice, so if you don't know it you'll get the question wrong. There's a lot of material and he expects you to know almost every minute detail. Doing assignments aren't that hard, but they're long. His tests are unrealistically hard. The homework contains 20+ pages from Harvard Business School.","Don't choose him because he'll expect you to master the material to his level. You won't learn much the first half of the course and his class will most likely cost your grade. This is not a core level class because he forces you to come to class and be as immersed as he is with the subject.","This is my hardest class even with concentration classes because of the amount of work he gives. The tests are ridiculously hard. The homework and class material are straightforward, but his tests are on a different level, which makes no sense. I lost my interest because he doesn't prepare you.  He expects his students to love it as much as he does","Professor is very friendly. Most of the class is taught from power points but there are frequent debates based on readings and an assignment. If you do the readings and debate assignments the class will be easy.

I had prior knowledge about issues in international business and haven't learned anything new in this class, except a few specific case studies.

If you can keep up with the reading and small writing assignments and love to debate and participate this class is for you. Very helpful and interesting professor!","Professor Dau is passionate and wants students to succeed.  He is eager to listen to and meet student needs while maintaining the integrity of class content. His workload is heavy, but readings are enlightening and case studies and activities supplement textbook reading perfectly, unlike some other classes.  Don't be intimidated, he's very helpful!","He's is a motivating professor, extremely supportive  and makes sure no one feels left out!","Professor Dau is a pretty good teacher who is very passionate about teaching. He is a very nice guy and the exams for the most part are straight forward. Unfortunately on the final he did not warn students that it would be much harder than the prior exams and he grades the projects very critically.","Dau takes this course very seriously. Attendance and participation are taken daily. Expect a lot of in-class discussions and debated. His lectures are all straight from the textbook, and his exams cover all the main topics that he goes over in class. Overall a nice guy and an easy class.

I ended up skipping more than I went because going would just confuse me. If you get him, show up for the first week and then just log onto the socrative app from your bed at the end of each class time to take the one question quiz. Get a good TA (not Nick) and they will teach you whatever you need to know.","Prof. Davies is very sweet and makes an effort to meet every one of his students outside of class. His midterms are very easy, and he provides practice midterms. However, his lectures are often confusing and you must be prepared to learn much of the material on your own or in recitation. Lecture quizzes are given about once a week in class.","Davies is such a nice man who really loves chemistry. However his lectures are really unclear and make it hard to pay attention. As someone who has always struggled with chem, the bulk of my learning came from the weekly recitations and outside tutoring. I left this course feeling unprepared for my following chem course.","Davies is a cute old man. He seems to love his job and what he does; however, I don't think I learned much from him. His TAs were more helpful. However, Davies allows a notecard for each exam - so you get to write whatever you want on it and bring it in for a cheat sheet. He began doing online pop quizzes which you can do from your dorm.","Davies is a very nice man, but I really don't feel like I actually learned anything in the class.  If you plan on actually using the chemistry you learn in gen chem 1 later on in your major (like if you have to take organic chem) you should really choose a different professor so you actually learn the basics.  The recitations are super helpful.","One of the nicest people I've ever met. Loves his students and evident that he loves Chemistry. However, he's a terrible teacher. Hard to follow in class due to his random stories (They are funny though). Tries to explain questions leading to more confusion. Better off reading the book, attending recitation, and doing the practice midterms.","His class is extremely easy, but his lectures are unclear and not helpful. I went to class only for the pop lecture quizzes, but now that they are online you can have someone share the code with you and do them from elsewhere. The textbook is not helpful. Just know how to do the practice midterms forward and backward and you will get an A.","He is such a sweet man, but he is an absolutely terrible teacher. Most of the time in lecture I can't follow what he's saying because he's just spouting nonsense. Recitation is a lifesaver and so is reading the book. The exams are tough because he doesn't really teach well, but if you put in work outside of class and do your homework, you're fine.","Incredibly sweet old man.  If you put in the work, you will get an A.  He wants nothing more than for you to do well and love Chemistry as much as he does!","He's so cute but his lectures don't always make sense. Easy class--he wants you to succeed. You get unlimited tries for the online homework. For the final, if your grade is higher than one of your previous tests he'll replace that test grade with the final's grade.","Not super helpful, hard to get an A.","Do the practice exams, attend recitation, and don't be afraid to get a tutor. His lectures are confusing but he likes to give one question quizzes randomly so it's important to go to class. If you want to pass, you're going to have to teach yourself a lot of material.","He is a very nice guy, but unfortunately a terrible professor.  Make sure you go to recitation, do homework, and look at the textbook if you want to pass the class. He honestly just rambles in class and you never learn anything.   Practice mid terms are given  are very similar to actual exam.","He lies when he says you'll all get an A in his class. Even if you've had chem before his class, he'll leave you more confused than ever. If it wasn't for my TA and maybe the textbook, I would not have passed. If you want to learn, work your butt off in Toher's class instead. It's worth it because you will understand it.","I really enjoyed the class. I struggled at first with the test format. 25 question tests is rough, but if you can do the practice midterms, you'll be fine. Ended up with a 97, definitely manageable.","Professor Davies is a great person but not the best professor. If you go to him he'll definitely help you, but otherwise you are on your own. You only have to go to class because of lecture quizzes but in my case lecture did not help much. Study the Practice MidTerms and read the book, if you do this you can definitely get an A. Good luck!","This guy is a terrible teacher. He doesn't teach at all, and he goes off on random tangents during class. He also wastes at least 10-15 minutes at the beginning of class calling people out to introduce themselves. He doesn't write anything on the board. There are no visuals to follow when taking this class. Switch out ASAP.","He's a really nice person but doesn't teach at all. His exams are really short so even a few mistakes will cause you to go down to a B; plus multiple choice does not allow for partial credit. I wouldn't recommend especially if you have no knowledge of chemistry and if you are planning to take higher level chemistry classes.","He's the sweetest little old British man but he's so difficult to hear and understand. Going to class is fruitless, save for the many quizzes you will take. Recitation will be your savior. Tests can be ridiculously easy or absolutely frustrating because he did not cover the material well.","He is a adorable old man. He is not explaining things very well but at least he is funny.

As somebody said above, this guy is absolutely brilliant.  He will kick your butt, but it's all for your own good in the end.  He seems to really care about teaching, and it shows.","Avoid software dev with him unless you want to do 30+ hours of homework a week. I learned a lot from the class, but the workload simply wasn't worth it. He makes assignments intentionally unclear just to piss you off. He claims it simulates the real world. That may be true, but that's also what co-op is for. Avoid him if at all possible.","Class consumed my life but it was worth it. Don't let my ratings fool you, the teacher was intentionally unclear and unhelpful to simulate real life. However, the course itself is one of the best I've taken at Northeastern and will help you improve a lot.","Purposefully ambiguous for no reason.  Overall, a huge jerk who doesn't even follow his own grading system.  Don't take software dev with him.","I love how he comes to class empty handed. He definitely knows what he's talking about. The man's brilliant.","For some reason this guy liked to bash all the business majors (some of which end up managing the CS people), but other than that he taught well.","This teacher is awsome, my class is @ 9:15am, but he makes it so intresting.

Fundamentals shows you both the beauty and the difficulty of programming.","excellent. hes intimidating, but its good. he forces you to learn or suffer and drop CS. hes good for a first cs class bc he makesc (not literally) the people that arnt up to it to drop from the cs major.","He was definitely the hardest and one of the most brilliant professors I have ever had. I have also learned more in his class than I had in most others. The projects and code-walks were consuming pretty much all of my time (days, nights, weekends, holidays), but I think that I landed my first job thanks to that class.","Very unique guy, great personality, nice teaching style.  HE MAKES YOU WORK, but that isn't a bad thing.  Lots of class interaction.  He has an accent, but it's not overwhelming.  He wrote the book we used.  Highly recommended (you probably have to take him anyway).","He is the man! Felleisen will make you talk in class even if you don't want to, that's not a choice!  He will try to bring out the leader in you, involves you in many class discussions and doesn't care if ur shy or not.  At first intimidating, but a very very good teacher.  If you WANT to learn, you will learn a LOT from this guy. A++++++++","Very loud and energetic, I thought he was hilarious. Most hw assignments were pretty easy, just alot of **** lab assistants.

He is a nice professor but needs to work on lectures.","DONT TAKE THIS. He knows a lot, don't get me wrong. But knowledge is only half the heart of teaching. He cannot communicate effectively, made a joke out of most question regarding the essay he assigns. If you've already done a Cold War class, don't do this. Never mind, don't do this regardless. The TA is your friend, the teacher will confuse you.","Class isn't difficult, with 20% participation credit it is difficult to get a clear grasp of how you're doing in the class. The midterm and finals are essays, but only got the midterm back 1 week before the final prompt , so you're not given a lot of time to understand what you did wrong. His lectures seem unimportant, he rambles and presentations.","Fraunholtz is not the type of professor you want if you're looking for an easy A. I worked my butt off every single week and managed to read every single assigned reading just on time--it was very tough. He assigned four or five books in the accelerated summer course which is CRAZY! That being said, I learned a lot and enjoyed the course immensely.","Took his class online. A ton of reading and all 5(?) of the books are necessary. Weekly discussions need quotations from the books and need to be very detailed (extremely difficult to get an A on these). Multiple sets of directions for the class papers with contradicting instructions, (8 pages vs 12 pages, ect.) Not terrible but not great.","He is a great professor, very approachable and explains everything very clear. A lot of group work, a lot of work in general but he can always can explain things again also his TA's very nice. He uses PowerPoint, documentary and books so we will have a lot of information to work on. he is not a super tough grader but u should work hard","Hard class. Tons of information. Lots of reading and group projects. But in the end, you learn A LOT. You learn to look at history more analytically. Lots of essays, but he isn't a super tough grader. Take this class if you're willing to learn, put in the effort, and be a good group member. Don't take it if you want an easy A.","I really enjoyed this class and the professor that taught it. I learned more than any class I have taken at Northeastern. Lectures were engaging. All this aside, there definitely was a LOT of work. Be prepared for that when you walk in on the first day: essay tests, 12 page papers, group projects, and lots of required reading.","I thought he was fine. Tests aren't bad as long as you go to lectures and study. One 12 page paper, but there's plenty of information to write about and you get to choose from different topics. Lectures are broken up with documents and films. I would not say get out immediately... but you should buy the books and be willing to try.","Prof. Fraunhotlz is fairly rude to students and not very open to other points of view, but his class wasn't terrible.  He broke up the class with videos and documents so that it wasn't just solid lecture.  He was a fair grader and I thought the amount of reading was manageable.","He is the worst teacher I have ever had at Northeastern. He sits up in the front of class and reads off a timeline. He is rude and mean. He makes everyone do group presentations on the readings so that he doesn't have to teach. He assigns a stupid 12 page paper and tells you that you need 5 main points 5-7 sentences each main point, doesn't add up.","The WORST class I've had at Northeastern so far! MORE READING THAN YOU CAN HANDLE; from a ton of books which cost $$$! RIDICULOUS 12 page papers for only a 200 level course! His lectures are IMPOSSIBLE to take notes on, yet alone stay awake! Exams are all essays. I feel so bad for you if you get him for this class. DO NOT TAKE! REPEAT! DO NOT TAKE!","The hardest professor at Northeastern! Hundred page readings every night and weekly presentations! Handouts in class are extremely important for the midterm but the final is take home (two 5 page essays). Lectures are boring and is an extremely tough grader! DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! EVER!","DO NOT TAKE HIM. He is one of the meanest teachers you'll have. He is unnapproachable, makes students give presentations every friday and is an impossible grader. STAY AWAY","Professor Fraunholtz is rude to his students and, even when the entire class is at a loss, continues to lecture and confuse everyone. Go to class, because he passes out about 8 handouts a day that you WILL be tested on. And don't plan on leaving class when it ends - he thinks its kosher to keep lecturing 10+ min. after class has ended. HORRIBLE!!!!","A TON of reading. The 2x a week was pretty rough as the class was an hour and a half long. The material can be really interesting, but his voice definitely gets old after the first hour.  In essence, it was boring.","If you take any HST class make sure it's 3x/wk & not 2 (way too long otherwise). Very boring. Way too many reading assignments-2 semester's worth for 1.

And BTW, he will take a screenshot of these commends on rate my professor and discuss in class. Have fun:)","I loved Paul so much. I found that students either loved him or hated him. Get on his good side (participate and talk in class) and he will love you too. Easy B, hard A class. Be prepared to do work, although it isn't at all overwhelming. I would recommend Paul to anyone.

Other than that really great class, not too much homework just reading the chapters before class and he'll ask you what was covered. Tests are reasonable.","Paul is a cool guy. He will give a few pop quizzes to make sure you are reading. He likes class participation since he gets bored without it. He will get distracted if you get up out of your seat or are surfing the web o your labtop/phone so don't do that. He takes attendance so definitely show up. Tests are easy if you know how to study.","Paul is a great professor. He makes every class relatable by providing a lot of examples  and enjoyable by showing videos and pictures to help teach course content. He is very engaged with the class and acts pretty much like one of the bros. To do well you must read the textbook and show up to class on time-he knows when you don't! Easy B, hard A.","Amazing Professor. He is the most hilarious professor in NU.","I made a rate my professor account solely because of the bad rating Fombelle just got. He is the best professor ever, and every kid I know absolutely loved him. Build your entire schedule around getting into his class. Extremely nice and helpful, and makes the class fun.","Bad? I'm not saying he's a bad teacher. I'm sure he's very good in doing his work but he's very rude and impolite!!! He doesn't respect his students at all. I was so scared when I was in class with him because he was always making jokes about students and treating everyone very badly. Someone liked him; the majority of us don't!","Professor Fombelle is a really funny and charismatic teacher. He is an extremely hard grader, and you would most likely get a letter grade higher taking marketing with another professor. Participation was worth a lot and it was hard to earn. Also, he grades the group projects extremely hard. He is a great professor but a very tough grader","Take him! Tests are do-able as long as you pay attention in class and read beforehand. Participation is very important, as is reading the chapters before class because sometimes he'll throw a pop quiz in there.  He keeps the class interesting, has a great sense of humor, and you learn in an enjoyable environment.","The in-class participation is really ridiculous. The presentation  is hard to get higher than B+.","One of the best professors Ive had at Northeastern. Classes are fun, you never get bored. Read the chapters and you will be fine. Exams are fair and not too hard.","Not a good upper level professor. Pop quizes and his participation requirements are ridiculous, and patronizing to say the least. His tests are also horrible- just memorization of unimportant tables/flow charts from the book. Learned very little in this class. He's also incredibly pompous.","Honestly I believe Fombelle was a great intro teacher but does not understand how to teach an upper level course. Other than the fact that he is pompous and arrogant, he treats his students as if they are freshmen. The reading pop quizzes and a paper stating every time you participate is busy work and not appropriate for junior/senior level course","Lectures are engaging and fun. Never a boring day. Definitely take him if you have the opportunity, one of the best professors I've had at Northeastern","Professor paUL is a gem of Northeastern.  He is totally worth rearranging your schedule for-- do whatever it takes to get him.  Make sure you express your love for Best Buy/hatred for nature/sports in the first class and you'll be golden.","Best Professor. My concentration was Finance, I am now double majoring in Marketing and Finance, only because of him. He is one of those teachers that inspire you with their teaching. Absolutely love his sense of humor and wit! If you get an opportunity to take his class don't miss it!! -- but be willing to work.","Prof. Paul is the BOMB. Tests are straightforward and clear.  His lectures are engaging and he is very relate able.  I can't wait to take another class with him.","actually runs a dynamic, interesting class which most cba professors do not. lots of funny videos/jokes, keeps mood light. tests are totally reasonable, reviews everything beforehand. no homework whatsoever besides the simulation. has a lot of interesting experience and stories - really knows his stuff. 100% recommend","Good Professor.

He had to drop an entire exam (lowest of 3) so students wouldn't get C's and D's. Work hard, and you'll do fine. No need to buy the textbook, he uploads all necessary readings/assignments to blackboard.","He is definitely NOT super easy. It is clear that this semester he changed his methods. He doesn't give study guides or any kind of material to prepare for the test other than his lecture notes. He is in love with stats and he is very helpful and funny but don't expect an A if you don't work hard for it.","His tests are the exact same as the practice quizzes online (different numbers), so as long as you study those you will be fine. Lectures can be confusing, but again you don't really even need them as long as you study the practice quizzes.","Best Professor in NEU","This class was so easy! All of his tests are based directly off of the review packets he gives out. Most of the test questions are exactly the same as the ones in the packet.

Honestly do not think of taking this class with anyone else.","He's a sweet man, very enthusiastic about the material he's teaching.

He is incredibly knowledgeable, passionate, and just an overall great guy! He is always willing to talk outside of class and give advice on assignments. He also gives the option of taking out of class trips rather than write papers. I wish I could take every history class with him.","Dr. Fowler is one of the best professors at Northeastern. I have him for Colonial and Revolutionary America. He clearly loves History and is extremely knowable. We've all learned the history of America since grade school, but Fowler always adds interesting facts and stories I never knew before.

I really enjoyed class with her and found the in class discussions to be stimulating and educational. A lot of people seem to be down grading her because she's a feminist which is really quite a shame as not kind of cultural study can be taught divorced from feminism.","WORST Professor I have ever had. Ridiculously tough grader and will pick you up for things such as Split infinitives and comma splices. Unnecessary in a film class. She picks favourites and will use your opinionagainst you if it differs from hers. Unhelpful and useless comments on papers and then when asked about them, she still has nothing to say.","had her for Shakespeare, and I really enjoyed her. managed to make a 3.5 hour class on 16th cent plays fly by! she is a very nice woman, but expects a lot from her students, especially class participation. speak in her class a few times and she will like you! I never thought I would enjoy intro to shakespeare, but I really did :)","She is very helpfull! And kind! Se is very understanding!! The best professor I had here. She  should teach more classes...","Awesome..maybe not the class materials but the professor! She is great, she didn't share much of her personal life- was kind of in a distance. =( Was very helpful if we had questions regarding the class or regarding anything. Because of her, I loved the class!","Extreme liberal feminist and if she feels you do not agree with her that will reflect on your grades. Preached too much about Bush and never about what we are actually supposed to learn. Tried has an agenda that has nothing to do with english","ridicuously easy grader on papers and tests, I did almost none of the readings and I always got A's.  That aside, very boring class, and it doesn't seem like she really knows what she's doing.  She picks favorites and only allows one absence for the semester.","Awful, awful, awful. I'm a film student and I wanted to throw up coming to this class. Did not teach what Film and Text is supposed to be. Instead, it because a pro-Gay course (I'm gay, and I thought it was ridiculous and unnecessary to base any portion of this class on homosexual ideals.) I withdrew and got a &quot;W&quot;. SHOULDNT BE TEACHING CIN. STUDIES","I thought she was nice and very understanding. She knew that we were all freshman and that her class was the LAST one that we wanted to take. She was a hard grader though. She was interesting to talk to and we had some interesting conversations in class.","Papers are graded a lot on opinion, and assignments arent alwats clear.  She brings up good points, and is helpful if you ask.  Somewhat tough grader.","Easy A if you know what you are writing and you should be talking to her about your paper 20X before you submit your final paper.","I was completely interested in this class BEFORE I had her as a teacher. I withdrew based on the fact that she did not want to hear what I had to say and thought my opinions were meaningless. She is very much a feminist and has solid views on how things should be. She picks her favorites in the beginning and detests anyone else. Horrible class.","If you blindly listen to what this woman has to say in class, you will come away thinking that all of film theory is about how women are objectified.  This is not a film theory class.  Rather, it is soley about feminism.  Get used to her preaching things like: &quot;women are always seen as inferior to men...Blah blah blah.&quot;  BAD CLASS!","Bases class on her own personal politics. The class became a feminist theory course and she went out of her way to antagonize the male students, all three of them. Oftentimes her theories of female oppression are blatantly incorrect, more often a far stretch. Her French is execrable, also. NOT recommended.","duno if she teaches this class anymore, but mediocre at best. I'm not a writing/film/lit major so some of the stuff we did was awful. However, not a bad teacher by any means. She knows what shes talking about, but sometimes i was confused about what she wanted in a paper. She wants kids to do well. I got a good grade in the class with average work","strange teaching methods- topics of conversation were interesting but the overall structure of the class was lacking","Worst class EVER. A complete and utter waste of time and money. As an English major I have become accustomed to receiving high marks on papers, especially reflections, which are supposed to be YOUR personal interpretations of something. Apparently no one told this woman that cause she gave most of us check-minuses on everything.","I don't know what the hell is wrong with you people, she is an amazing professor. I not only learned but I actually enjoyed coming to class, I don't doubt that the reason she got a low score is people are too smallminded to listen to someone else's beliefs","if you put the effort in you'll understand the concepts.  she is a hard grader but she is nice in class.  as long as you can bring a valid point in class and back it up she will accept it.","Is nasty and tries to impose her political views on students.

Very little work besides a few simple assignments and nothing was really hard. Didn't think it was necessary to read the book, tests focused on powerpoints and vocab. Found it quite boring and tempting to skip class, as the material he covered in 100 minutes could be done in 30","I was in the same class as the person below me & I COMPLETELY disagree.

His lectures are pretty funny & entertaining & if you go to his office hours he's very helpful.

Some numbers like odd percents that had to be memorized but overall a really easy class, would recommend for psych majors and others.","Great professor. Easy class to fail if you do not read the text but easy class to get an A in if you pay attention and read.  Recommended.","Professor Gruber was a great teacher as far as enthusiasm and knowledge on the subject. Because Foundations is a lecture class it is hard to know what is exactly on the 3 tests, of which your grade is dependent on. Most test questions were from the book and not from in class discussion.","I like him as a professor because hes always willing to help and answer your questions if you don't understand something. He is the best!!! Absolutely my favorite.","Professor Gruber obviously cares very much about the field of psychology, but there is a lot of room for improvement. While he presents a great deal of information in the lectures, the entirety of his tests can be taken straight from the book.

Not worth it.","Carlene isn't just a professor, she's a mentor. She will fight for you to the death, but also immediately call you out for slacking. She will make you work for your grade and challenge you at every corner. If you take her courses, however, you will undoubtedly emerge as a stronger journalist. Don't be afraid to stand up to her.","I STILL have PTSD after taking Journalism 2 with her. I cried all the time because of this class. No voice recorder for interviews? Pretty archaic if you ask me. She is really hard to work with; I agree with the \"my way or the highway\" attitude. Work  SUPER hard or else you're screwed.","Carlene is easily the toughest teacher I've encountered at NU and her classes will completely stress you out. But she really knows her stuff and will make you such a better writer. There's NO cutting corners or getting away with not giving it your absolute best. Definitely recommend her classes, she is awesome","The class itself was pretty helpful. Carlene is tough though. Fairly archaic journalism methods (loves newspapers, doesn't allow voice recorders for interviews, pretty anti-tech all around). Difficult to work with her if she disagrees with you, and there's a good chance she will.","Intense, don't get give less than 100%. Ever. Gives tough assignments and throws you to the wolves early.  Yes,treat the course as a job, she'll push limits and give assignments that require jumping through hoops.  You really need to focus on honing your skills, because the final requires instinct over memory. Real 'rite of passage' type prof.","Carlene was an excellent professor! She demands a lot and isn't the easiest grader but she is always willing to help. If you want to become a better writer definitely take the class!","Don't take this class if you are an athlete.","Carlene scared the crap out of me. She is TOUGH but if you can survive her madness it will make you a far better journalism. Taking her class was like having a child, it was a full time job. You cannot slack, wait till the last minute or try to cut corners. Strick on cell phones. DO NOT SLACK and youll succeed in her class.","Carlene is very enthusiastic about journalism. It's hard not to enjoy, but she does teach somewhat antiquated methods (not allowed to record interviews and have to write longhand). Apart from that, J1 is very enjoyable with her. She's very open, is easy to talk to and will help whenever she can.","I had Carlene for both J2 and Magazine Writing.

If you get the chance to have a class with her, it would be worth your while!!","OK people, here's the deal with Carlene: If you're interested in journalism and want to seriously make a career of it, there is no one better than her. She's a wonderful person and tells it like it is. She'll write you recommendation letters if you do well too. Carlene is amazing, simple as that, but be prepared to work, she expects you to.","She is not that great of a teacher if she doesn't like you personally. She has a very &quot;my way or the highway&quot; attitude. I used to schedule appointments to see her outside class and she wouldn't show up!","She thinks she's a gift to the world of journalism.  Learn your AP style because it's on the tests and she grades you down if you don't have things the right way on an article.  I definitely recommend going to her office hours and having her edit your stuff before turning it in.  She doesn't mind at all and it'll definitely help your grade.","She is so nice and helpful!

It was just the right amount of difficulty.","Hempel is the best journalism teacher I've had in my five years at NU. I took J1 and J2 from her. She is by far the hardest of the teachers, but you will become a better writer/reporter because of it. While she is demanding she is very nice and will help you outside of class even after you complete the class.","No Comments","Ok, not that great.","She had this attitude of being better than us because we're students and she's a working journalist.

Overall a chill and funny guy, I wish I could take another class with him.","This is a lecture so BEWARE. But, Professor Herbeck manages to make lectures as engaging and fun as they can get. Also, the midterms and overall content of the course are pretty straightforward.","Loved the class","Herbeck is fantastic!  He makes his lectures very interesting and clearly knows what he's talking about.  He cares a  lot about his subject and his students and it shows.   He offers several extra credit opportunities, but his tests are very fair anyway.  He's a great professor and a funny guy; highly recommend!","Really great professor. His instructions and lectures are very clear. Lectures are long at times but he uses many clips which makes the class more interesting. Definitely recommend him!","Great professor. He's passionate about the subject (considering the textbook used is his) and makes it really interesting for all students. Approachable if you have any questions and even though he only bases the final grade off of 3 exams, he gives several easy extra credit opportunities if you're not much of a test taker.","Professor Herbeck gave great information on what to expect from the Comm department in the coming years. He really crafted a class that helped new students understand what is to come and how to react. I'm knowledgable on so many minute details because of his teachings.","One of the best professors I've ever had. Engaging, funny, knowledgable. Go to class, take notes, and you won't need to read the textbook.

Plus runs incredibly helpful review sessions.","Professor Herbeck is amazing and would definitely recommend others to take his class. There is  a lot of studying involved, but the material is not difficult.  As long as you show up for class, take notes and read the assigned chapters, you will pass the course.","Dale is an amazing professor, he makes learning easy to understand with lectures and lots of video clips and prepares all his student adequately for his exams.  Says \"kind of\" a lot, but is a MUST to take one of his classes during your career at NU whether a Comm major or not!","Dale is probably one of the best teachers I've ever had.

Go to class, take notes, and study from the study guide and you'll get an A. The study guide is all you need.","Gives only multiple choice tests, average difficulty. Keeps class light by alternating discussion about complex concepts with clips and other fun things that illustrate said concepts and make them tangible. Funny guy, really nice to talk to. Come to class and do the readings and I guarantee you'll be happy with your grade.","Herbeck's a cool guy and willing to talk with you if you have a problem.

Recommended!","DO NOT TAKE FILM MUSIC! This may seem like an easy A elective, but it is anything but. Even though this class is for non-majors, he takes this class way too seriously. There are so many assignments and readings every week, and you need to watch at least one movie a week. He is disorganized and unclear and grades the essays too harshly.","Ho is an experience.

I cannot stress enough how bad it was. The professor is not bad, but the content is impossible for an 1100 class. If you are not a music major STAY AWAY.

He teaches at a very fast pace, but slows down if students ask and seems to be learning to ask students if he needs to slow down. Weekly quizzes, and nightly homeworks, with a final project and two exams. He's probably the most likely teacher to really get you excited about music theory.","Having Professor Ho for Film Music has been a nightmare. The timeline for assignments in class is so messed up that you never end up completing them all. He assigns group papers with a short page limit, so you cannot add enough info to get a good grade. He also expects you to write critical analyses WHILE using other sources.... Stay away.","Professor ho is a brilliant professor, very skilled in music. hes a little unclear sometimes and expects you to know dates from the syllabus without him explicitly saying so. class was pretty easy and straightforward","I've had professor Ho for 3 different classes now, and I'll be taking a 4th with him in the Fall. He is a brilliant mind, a hilarious (but corny) guy, and is always willing to help students in need. He moves very quickly but will slow down when asked. Some people won't like how upfront he is, but honestly, this man is a genius, take his classes.","Hubert Ho has changed the way I see music, arrange my furniture and talk to my friends and family. He is ridiculous. Did I mention he has perfect pitch&#63; Honestly, Hubert is a great guy, with a sense of humor and a firm understanding of his field. Class flies by (my first time check is usually half way through class) and Hubert makes it interesting.","Great professor, really goes in depth individually correcting your capstone drafts so you know exactly what you need to do to get a 100. Keeps things light - makes a lot of jokes and plays a lot of videos but also seriously knows what he's talking about. Majored in physics/music at harvard so yeah, smart guy","Hubert is not afraid to act silly in front of the class in order to get his point across. He actually cares about students and always answered the few questions I had completely. I really enjoyed his class and learned aspects of film that I'll never forget. I think he's a great teacher overall and the class was easy.","He's a nice guy. He explains things pretty well and the mid-term and final aren't so bad if you follow his powerpoints and pay attention in class. He's not afraid to sound a little dorky when he starts humming out different tunes, and I'm glad he does because it really helps you understand exactly what he's talking about.

Do the optional HW and you will be satisfied.. I took calc and differenial equations for biology with her she is a good teacher, and she has an accent but it is not a barrier at all.","Incredibly sweet and helpful.  A little hard to understand but she writes everything on the board that she says because she understands that her english is not the most clear.  If you put in just a little bit of time you will get an A!","Great professor, best math teacher I ever had. Notes are organized, because she write in an organized way. Thank you for everything","Bo is awesome honestly! The biggest issue I can see anyone having is the accent, but do not fret! I got used to it pretty quickly. She's pretty funny too and super clear about most , if not all, topics covered in class. Quizzes and the final exam grades are basically your grade, but she drops the lowest one!","She has a thick accent but if you really listen to her and follow her work, she is incredibly straightforward. She loves class participation and will offer bonus points for solving problems on the board. Practice exams are nearly identical to the real exams and she'll go through them with you. Nice, helpful, funny, and knows her stuff.","Absolutely amazing professor. She has an accept but you get used to it. gives good feedback. makes sure you understand what she is teaching. respectful of confused students, encouraged questions. extra credit is guaranteed 5 on final grade. understands the student struggle and cuts you slack. if confused, do the hw, ask questions, you'll be fine.","Bo is truly a marvelous teacher. I took AP Calculus my senior year in high school and decided to retake the course as I believed that I hadn't truly learned anything. Bo helped me to solidify the concepts I had learned before, as well as teach me new concepts that my old teacher had not touched on. I definitely recommend her to anyone!","So yea she is as nice as the other reviews, but her accent is so think I could not understand her the entire semester. My GPA is now jeopardized because of her. This is suppose to be an easy class since she does not teach tan, cos, sin, but her accent just ruins everything.","She's so nice! Even though her accent might be sometimes confusing, she is clear and organized. Pay attention and you'll do well","She is the best teacher I've met. She gives clear explanation, good answers and very good grades for all the students. Her class is pretty easy if u do the homework and pay attention during the class. She is such a lovely person. She is so Nice and helpful. Take her class and u will not regret!","She may have a thick accent but she writes down everything she says. In a way I like this teaching method a lot since I have like very clear notes and can just look through it when I needed to. Her quizs are really easy as long as you go though her quiz reviews you'll be fine because her reviews are very similar to the questions on her quizs.","I felt kind of insulted to be in her Stats and Software class. The first half of the course was things I learned in elementary school, and I feel like I myself could have taught the second half better than she did. If you want to be mentally challenged or want to actually understand the formulas you use, take a different class or professor.","She is so helpful and nice about everything. She makes it hard to fail the quizzes as long you do the homework and participate in class. She gives bonus points for participation and often scales the quizzes and tests. Her quizzes are also not particularly hard. She is one of the best math teachers I've ever had.","She is SO NICE! She really makes sure that you understand the material and gives you plenty of opportunities for making up poor grades. I had her for Statistics and Software and never had a problem. Her english isn't very good but you can still make out most of what she says so it isn't a big issue.","Very nice and she really knew what she was talking about... but had a very thick oriental accent which made her almost incomprehensible to me.. many times i could not understand what she was saying","One of the nicest professors I have had.  She is very patient and makes sure everyone knows the material before moving on.  She's also very reasonable about quiz and test grades.  Her notes are very clear and efficient.  She makes class relaxing while still conveying all of the material at a relatively fast pace.  Great teacher.","She is an amazing professor, who really wants to see everyone succeed. She drops the three lowest quiz grades and gives quizzes based off the homework and in class examples.  I would strongly suggest coming to class, taking notes, and paying attention and you should earn a good grade!!","(Calc&dfq for Bio1) Really great professor! Very patient, and helpful.

I spent a month trying to arrange a mandatory meeting because I can't make his office hours, he never once suggested a time. Passive aggressive about my EXCUSED absentees until he tried to fail me because of them. Avoid unless your a perfectionist who can stay on his good side.","Very enthusiastic and friendly. He made Advanced Writing as fun as it could be. Lots of writing assignments and verbose rubrics. Class was enjoyable, though, and he's definitely helpful and committed to his teaching.","While the professor provides students with an extensive number of assignments which can be overwhelming at times, I found a drastic improvement in my writing abilities over time. My quality of work and ability to challenge myself has also increased in capacity.","Great professor! Very interesting; obvious that he really cared about the subject (novels from the modern period) and the students. Gave a variety of assignments which really helped to learn the material in different ways, leading to deeper learning. Very fair grader, and always willing to help if you need it.

The assignments were varied, grading was fair, pace was just right for a 4000 level course. Don't let the other 1st year \"college writing\" course reviews fool you, he's a great professor, especially with this topic.","Assigns a LOT of writing, but if you actually buckle down and do it, the actual class period is pretty fun.","Really great teacher and easy to do well if you follow directions and stay on top of your work.","Keeling is funny.  Keeling is smart.  Keeling is REALLY demanding.  If you're a slacker, then take another professor.  But if you want to be challenged and exposed to new ideas, then Keeling is your MAN!","Bret is fantastic.

And he provides helpful and FAST feedback to ALL assignments.  Whenever I emailed him with a question, he got back to me within hours (not days!) with a definitive answer.","Extraordinary professor! Take his class if you actually want to do work as he assigns a lot of essays. He goes easy on the word count for the little assignments leading up to the portfolio (four of them altogether). Funny guy. I honestly don't see what other people are complaining about.","While he seems like a great guy at the beginning, most of his expectations and assignements are way over board for a college writing class. He expects you to understand the same things he does from complex books and essays, but he is a PhD!! Take another professor if you're looking for a simple, straightforward class to improve your writing skills.","Very best English professor I ever had.  He is the definition of a student centered teacher.  Any student who slanders him is a student who is lazy.  He expects that students do the work... which is how it it supposed to be.  He is also funny and diligently gives great feedback.","Very condescending. Not very straight forward. Class itself is not hard, he is not helpful or understanding with any circumstances that arise. Would strongly recommend a different professor.","Bret is honestly the worst professor I have ever encountered. He makes you feel stupid for asking a question and on top of that never even remotely answers your question. Very difficult to work with. Would not recommend him ever, to anyone.","This an online class.  A bunch of people in this class should NOT have taken an online class!  They had no idea of how to meet a DEADLINE!  Some girl complained about Dr Keeling all the time, but I saw what she submitted, and she should have FAILED!  Dr Keeling was GREAT!  He is ORGANIZED and he is PROFESSIONAL.  His grading is FAIR and CLEAR.","I had Bret at UW 12 years ago, when I was a BA student. I am a PhD student now and still remember this class. It was frustrating, challenging and, ultimately, AMAZING. Maybe you are a student looking for an easy class, don't take him. But if you are looking for something memorable, terrifying and life-changing, Bret is your guy. Mark Walters, UCSD.","By far one of the best professors I have ever had. Highly intelligent, funny, makes you a better writer and student.","Bret is the man. People are just frustrated because they actually had to do work. His class is by no means easy but as long as you show up and turn in the assignments on time you will do well. He is hands down the most helpful and approachable professor I have ever had.

His grading is unclear, he's rude in his responses and nothing is learned from him as a teacher. It's sad, really.","This is the absolute worst course I took at NEU.  Kesner is an autocrat with a big ego and teaching IT material that is 20 years outdated.  He is rude, unreasonable and egotistical.  He gives 15+ hrs/wk in busy-work homework. This is supposed to be a basic MIS course but its actually one of the hardest.  He tests trick questions found nowhere.","Kesner is he hardest and most unreasonable Professor I have ever taken at NEU. Ridiculous amount of work and he does not take criticism well. If you take other courses and work, forget it you will most likely not make it through this course with a decent grade. Unclear expectations, 16-20 Hrs weekly workload and egotistical Professor-- AVOID!","If you study hard, you will get the score you want. Don't take his class if you want an easy A. Participation grade is up to 10%, try to raise your hand twice each class, you will get a full participation grade(Not hard because there would be lots of questions he will ask in class). Go to his office hour if you have time, he is willing to answer.","He has extremely specific answers in mind for his questions which will never be clearly explained. His feedback is terrible and long winded without addressing your actual work. He often takes off \"half a point\" as partial credit, but that is out of 2 points total on 4 questions. He also gets extremely defensive about his teaching style.","Destroys any confidence you may have coming into this class. Has his own rule where he apparently doesn't give out A's, even if he's pleased with your work so seriously do not  expect one. He seems to think he's the expert on all things and has no respect for students at all. The person who wrote below me is correct, and yes he actually sent that.","To quote Kesner's own email to the class regarding our 2nd exam: \"Overall, the outcomes are pretty much like last time's... disappointing but there you have it.\"  Avoid this class at all costs! Kesner is egotistical, stubborn, and downright rude. I was excited to take MIS, he ruined that. Don't know how he's still teaching at Northeastern.","Harsh grader. Homework is due before he even teaches the subject. Expects a lot of participation. Not helpful when you ask questions, and is quite frankly kind of rude. Would not reccomend this professor for any subject ever. Sad that he has made this  class so unenjoyable when the subject could have been a lot more interesting/","For 3403 you will need to dedicate at least 20 hours a week (not including class) with your group if you want to get a B with Access assignments. Expectation are not clear because \"Customers don't give you clear expectations.\" I did learn a lot, but grades in other classes suffered due to this one. Check his grading he tends to miss things.","tough tough grader. don't take him. he expect you to learn ALL by yourself. he expect soooooo much participation in class, office hour and email. he does not answer questions. he throw them back to you. no textbook, he have articles for you","What a shame he made this class. MIS is very interesting, but this man is so rude and condescending. I did not feel that he wanted students to succeed. He was so paticular about things in a field where there are multiple answers. MIS is a growing field, but it is so small at NEU probably because he discourages students in the intro class.","If you are looking for an awful semester, take this class. Being an \"executive professor\", he may have held many important positions in the industry - but that does not transfer to teaching ability. He is pompous and arrogant. The most feedback you'll receive is \"ok\" or \"no\". No office hours. Cases  are logical, but his followup questions are not","This guy is the worst professor I've had at NU, and this is the last of 34 courses I've taken there. He is controlling, argumentative, rarely clear, and expects us to read his mind. I have never seen a professor be so nit-picky; he simply expects a regurgitation of the cases that he wrote 20+ years ago and will severely punish you if you don't.","Worst Professor I have ever had. Absolutely no clarity in his teaching. Way too abstract and expects just too much. If you write 40 pages for a 1 paragraph answer he will still have negative remarks and NEVER give full credit. Hard work can be a waste in this class. Highly suggest to never take him!","Kesner is by far the worst professor you could have for MIS. He wrote the entire course so he's pretty much full of himself so prepare to have your ideas shot down. He's condescending and expects you to know everything. Participation is a ridiculous amount of your grade so you'd better raise your hand every class or it'll really bring it down.","Don't do it.","He is one of the worst professor I've had. He worked in the industry when computers were not even around. I copied his direct notes for the test and he marked it wrong. A class of 26, 0 got A's, 4 people got B's and 6 got C's. He is awful! When I asked for help he said we went over this in class and  I should understand it. Not helpful at all!","Kesner is very unclear about what he wants on his homework assignments.

Very eager to help. Lots of extra credit definitely possible to get an A hard not to get at least a B.","Professor Kirss is an amazing teacher. He truly helps and does anything he can do to help you succeed. His passion for chemistry is adorable and care for students is admirable. Go to class, go to chem central, ask for help, and you should do completely fine in his class. Definitely recommend him!","Professor Kirss is AWESOME. He holds practice sessions and always has office hours where you can ask any questions. He is so passionate about Chemistry and it really rubs off on the students.

Don't expect to stay awake the whole class however. The exams are hard, but if you do well on the first two midterms, you could skip the third.

He always make students feel comfortable also his material always helps to me.","I strongly recommend to take his class. he is really great professor. the way he is teaching is to motivate  student not to give one way teaching. also he is friendly and willing to listen all students opinion and give comfortable atmosphere.","Duane was a great teacher who brought in a lot of class lecturers from the business world, which was awesome. Although there was a lot of group work, the class was still fun and informative. He was able to bring in a lot of examples from class. If you study for your tests you will get A's on them. Not sure how the other things are graded.","He doesn't care about students and he is  hard grader","Quite possibly the worst prof I have ever had. He is an unapproachable jerk and quite simply does not care about his students. He is a ridiculously hard grader and he is ruining my GPA.","He relies heavily on group grades & the reviews of other classmates. Almost nothing we learn in class is needed for the tests, which are just regurgitation of book info. He is very unfair in his grading and seems to haphazardly assign grades with very few quantitative metrics. People have seemed to like him for MKT but for INTB it was different.","Taking any class as a senior who was about to graduate and already had a job is going to be difficult. Especially when it is a class with a lot of your friends. However, Duane was able to keep every single class interesting. He treats you exactly how you would want to be treated in a senior capstone class. Would absolutely recommend this professor!","Prof Lefevre was an amazing prof who truly cared about his students. He came to class prepared and used an array of his own real life examples from living abroad and working in different aspects of marketing and business that contributed to our understanding and learning.  If you attend class and participate, you will do well and enjoy it!","One of the best professors I had at Northeastern! His lectures are always interesting and he invites great guest lecturers. All exam questions come from textbook so reading the textbook is a must in order to pass the exams.","Professor Lefevre is one of the best professors I had in Northeastern. He's always there for students and can be really funny in class. I would recommend taking his STRT4501 course if you are looking for an awesome professor to spend your last semester with. Be prepared for the 2 exams, and study all the required materials thoroughly. RECOMMEND! :)","Professor Lefevre is in my opinion a great professor. He will help you with any questions or concerns and makes the class very entertaining with real-life examples or guest speakers. His testing is fair and even curves the exams. Whichever professor you take, you will have to do 2 important group projects but he manages to help you and guide you.","His lectures are interesting and speakers are great. The only class I looked forward to attend. Would recommend!","Prof Lefevre was awesome. His lectures are always interesting and he invites great guest lecturers. Two big tips: 1. Participate in class often 2. Read the textbook before the midterm and final. Anyone who complains about the class being difficult didn't read the book. Although it doesn't seem essential during the semester, it'll help on the tests.","Really chill guy who cares about his students. Keeps the lectures intetesting with activities to break it up which was great!  Textbook really isn't necessary as we don't have any online homeworks, but does make studying for the tests A LOT easier, especially if you don't take notes in class. Take Lefevre!","Lefevre shows enthusiasm for the content. Beware of cold- calling - use it as an opportunity to show you do the case studies and pay attention. Grading on assignments can be tough - be careful of grammar and show critical thinking abilities. Read the textbook, study the learnsmarts (!!!) and you'll get As on the exams.","Definitely grabs your attention and his lectures are very well done.","Professor Lefevre was a great professor! He always used his extensive marketing background and professional experience to supplement the material presented in the textbook. Whether it was a case study or a new ad campaign, Professor Lefevre would always use supplementary materials to keep the class engaged. I would take another course with him!","He is an amazing professor. Probably the best professor for marketing as he knows this subject in and out.

With a department wide curriculum his students are more prepared for each exam than students in the other sections. While attendance isn't technically mandatory you will not do well if you miss his lectures.","Lerner makes you work for every point you get, but that's why he's such a great prof. Never unfair, but not going to give away any answers. If he's the one who wrote a test you're going to take, go in expecting to spend the full exam time trying to think through it.   If you can handle a hard class, can't recommend highly enough.","Took the honors section of CS2500. Very good at lecturing. Really cares about his students. Lerner demands the best out of everyone, and gives notoriously difficult assignments and tests, but most of the time, everything works out in the end.","Lerner is engaging, entertaining and a great teacher.

He sort of expects every student to come with a 100% solid Java skill, and only come to the class for highly philosophical MVC and other design patterns. Again, don't take his course before you finish a significant amount of online Java courses. 2/3 of my friends in this course dropped/failed.","The final homework project for classes of last semester was the first one for us. I dk if they are changing easiness of the course or it was just being mean.  Have to do self-eval *the day after*  you submitted each homework, otherwise you will receive a Zero. It has been annoying and pretty much breaks your schedule.  Pick another Prof if u can","Fundies is not easy but Lerner is a very good teacher.

Not only did I learn an enormous amount in the class, but when I had trouble with attendance near the end of the semester, she was very understanding and allowed me to earn back her good faith. Only negative was the lengthy reading assignments.","The only truly frustrating thing about Leslie's grading is that you can't get mad at it, even when you get bad grades, because she presents a fair and justified argument as to why you got marked down.  But she's incredibly passionate about literature and that's what you in the end truly need in an English professor.","A Lit major friend told me she is a wonderful teacher and a better person. Shakespeare was a mystery I endured in high school. Clueless. I understand so much more now. She's not an easy grader but she's fair. She is also as welcoming, helpful, and genuine as a professor should be. Few are. She is totally on your side. She has a wonderful face.","Leslie is incredibly intelligent.  The class definitely kept me on my toes, but I got out a lot about Shakespeare than I had imagined.  She's a hard grader, but at the same time she's a fair grader.  She'll let you know what you're doing wrong and show ways to correct it.","I'm not an English major and I hadn't read any Shakespeare before. This class made me love it. Class was awesome, learned a ton from lectures, talking about plot and characters was super fun. Close readings get you into the language. Great class discussions. Good times!","She is a really nice lady and a very intelligent woman, but as far as the class goes, (shakespeare) it wasnt intellectually stimulating at all. the entire class you spend talking about the plot and how you feel, how the characters feel,rather than literary elements or the incredible diction that IS shakespeare. the class itself was a dissapointment","Definitely the hardest English class I have taken here: three papers, take home final, and huge amounts of readings. Leslie is very experienced in this field, but she often accuses the class of not reading when we were not at the level she expected (kinda unfair to the kids who did read). Expect an oral presentation too.","okay, so i took shakespeare's comedies to fufill an english requirement The class was filled with those stereotypical english major girls who think they know EVERYTHING and that leslie's word is gospel.

Don't take this class.","I took the class twice... the first time was during my very first quarter of graduate school and I dropped it after 2 weeks because it was hopelessly more complex than I could understand.   I took it again during my last quarter and was AMAZED at the depth of information Karl presented.  He remains one of my two best graduate school professors.","The man is an enigma. He has you learn algorithms through the use of a &quot;game&quot;, which in theory is a very novel approach. In practice, it's sometimes a little silly (especially when you play by yourself). In class, he's fairly clear and is very receptive to people asking questions. Exams are open note.","The Game is useless and even if you ask exactly what you need to turn in for homeworks, you'll still be missing something. Avoid if possible, but you probably won't be able to.","This class is like starving to death.

You, and your GPA die, just as you came into this world, alone.","None of the comments on here are exaggerated. You will not believe how irrelevant and worthless this class is. You use buggy software and you may have grades that are LITERALLY random. He delegates ALL his work either to students or the TA, he does absolutely nothing. Class, tests, and homework have nothing to do with the course description. AVOID!","This class does nothing but indoctrinate the students into using a buggy and flawed piece of software called DemeterF. You will learn nothing about software development. A Student had to complain to the dean to get him to teach us testing methodologies, and even then we learned nothing. Avoid At All Costs, even if it means staying another semester.","NO. FALSE. NEIN. This class is an abomination. Epic fail. He doesn't teach anything about SD, like processes, version control, testing, SDLC, etc. Instead, he takes a math problem that he's interested in and forces you to use his buggy experimental framework to solve it. Expects you to be Java hackers and the TA often cancels office hours. AVOID!","Teaches nothing about Software Dev. Makes us do a project for his own gain. Assumes we're intense Java programmers even though we only took 2 classes with it (and learned nothing in them).","Horrible professor.  Just doesn't understand how much work he is assigning, or doesn't care.  Expect to spend upwards of 20 hours a week on the homework and expect to teach yourself too.","This class forces you to put in 25+ hours a week on the work.  The professor's apathy shines through in everything he does.  His website is a mish mosh of garbage which is bad when there's no real course text book.  Basically you're on your own in this class, don't plan on getting any help.  30+ hours a week will be spent on the project.","Tough class made tougher by a terrible instructor. He has some brilliant ideas about aspect-oriented programming, but he uses this course as a means of forcing them on you. There is no reason to use his language, except that it is required. Learned nothing about software dev. Terrible project spec, poor grammar. Gives helpful tips after due dates!","Absolutely ridiculous class.  No textbook, a TA who sounds like English is his 4th language, a stupid project that requries the use of buggy software, and to top it all off every single f---ing lecture was the same.

He loves demeterj and CSP a little too much...","The course was Secure Software Engineering. Or, at least, that's what it was called. It turned out to be a course in AspectJ and Demeter - really just him providing a forum for his students' research projects and trying to push AOP on everybody. I am told this is what ALL his classes are.","No Comments","His TA can not speak english.  His final project is retarted.  He teaches you DemeterJ wich is cool in theory but very buggy.  C's get degrees so hold on for the ride.  Its going to be a****ty semester.  You would think an upper level class in CS would teach you something useful but northeastern pulls through with another jackass professor.","He gets a reputation as being tough mostly because he is German (no lie, Germans tend to come across as dry and intimidating to Americans) and this course can be very demanding. However, this is THE most important course an aspiring programmer will take at NU and he does an excellent job presenting  theoretical and practical considerations of SD.","While the man is brilliant.  He is not a good teacher at all.  I think he just re-iterates over class notes he created years ago..When questions arrive..he seems befuddled.

But if you don't make sure you pay complete attention in class and take EVERY note, as his lectures are very helpful. Tests and quizzes are relevant to teachings. Sometimes does a poor job of fully explaining concepts. Final is deceptively easy..didn't do as well as I thought, wtf&#63;","HATED that class and him.

Bad: apparently doesn't realize students have other classes and assigned a gratuitious amount of work (and I didn't procrastinate). Reasonable final.

She's sooo funny and down-to-earth, which is VERY refreshing in academia. Class has a very communal feel.

He's eccentric, but once you get past it, he's a good professor. Explains things thoroughly.

However, after the first few weeks with Prof. Lang, I have significantly improved and regained my liking for math. He is very clear and precise with the work and quiz/test schedule.","On the first day of class, I have to admit, I was a little intimidated. But David is a great professor. He knows really his stuff. If you pay attention in class and do a little bit of homework, it shouldn't be very difficult to get an A. He's also a nice guy, and will occasionally crack a calculus joke here an there. He loves math.","I had him for clac 1 and he was a good very clear professor. He goes fast in the lectures so if you have no calc experience the class will probably be hard but if you have some then it will be easy. The quiz's are really easy and he gives one every week and he drops the lowest two. If you have a question in class he'll answer it.","Great professor. Loves math but is not a people person (although he is willing and available to help). He talks really quickly and the class is fast-paced. You should have a background in calc and be decent in basic algebra. Would definitely take again for a math course.","He never collects homework, which is a huge benefit, but it is fairly necessary to really understand what's going on.  He can be hard to take seriously because of his ill-fitting suits and very thick accent.  A solid background in calculus is also really important.","Good","Great teacher, way too excited about math.","He is an awesome professor.","I would recommend some experience in calculus before taking this class. He adores calculus and really knows his stuff, but he does not dumb it down (he regularly made me feel stupid for not understanding \"BASIC ALGEBRA!\" as he put it). Despite this, however, his review sheet made quizzes easy. You may find his ill-fitting suits  distracting...","Excellent guy. Knows his stuff. Just make sure you take notes and do the homework.","He likes calculus more than he likes people, but he's very enthusiastic and clear about every topic. Always available for office hours to help out and answer questions. Moves through topics pretty quickly, but the quizzes are not bad at all as long as you do the hw problems.","Great professor for Differential Equations. Very clear, very knowledgeable.

Do the readings so you can participate, although she goes over it in class. 4 Quizzes, one dropped, 4 extra opportunities, one paper, midterm and cumalitive final. She's also very good with answering email immediately.","Nice professor, she's cool. Hard grader though, no leway really. Your either right, or you dead wrong.

I studied hard and still bombed the tests. She's a Psych Professor...she wants to think she's smarter than you. The entire class is Power Point and BORING!!!! Psych can be interesting, too. I was disappointed!!!!","Fav professor this semester! She's extremely knowledgeable, always making helpful references to everyday & her work experience. Her speech is clear & easy to understand. All powerpoint lectures posted on blackboard. 5 MC tests. She makes it very clear what will be on exams. Doesn't take attendence but going to class & reading the book helps alot.","She seems annoyed when you ask a question!","This class was extremely easy.

He was always very clear and helpful inside and outside of class. It isn't unusual for him to respond to your emails within the hour if you need his help. As far as grading, he makes it extremely clear what he expects from you but  wants you to excel at it. Great no nonsense prof.","Best class I've ever taken","Probably the friendliest and most approachable prof at NU. He really knows his stuff and wants you to improve as an actor. He tries his best to make the class fun, which I thought it really was. As far as being a tough grader: If you complete the assignments as required and put in rehearsal time (which shows in your scene) you'll do well.","I love Jonathan. Yes, you have to give him a lot for you to give you a good grade, but you want to give him all that you can. Participation for this class is everything, but you can't be in an acting class without expecting to act. There is a significant amount of rehearsal expected outside of class, but only in the second half of the semester.","Sure he grades you on participation, which can be annoying, but it helps to keep you involved in the class. Jonathan is one of the nicest and most lighthearted professors I know, if you ever don't understand something or if you want to get more involved in theatre he's ready to help.","Jonathan was an amazing professor with an obvious passion for the class and the material. He is extremely fair in his grading. He expects you to bring your best to class everyday. Minimal assignments but each is worth a large part of your grade. Text book seems useless at some times but overall the class was very enjoyable.","The class is fun and you do meet nice people, but the professor is a very strict grader and demands participation. Would not recommend that you take him.","there are quizs based on two books and some really annoying papers. Sometimes the class is really boring, you are supposed to spend more than 12 hours each week on rehearsal. Not a easy class to get A- and not too much fun. The professor doesn't care about you that much.","Unless you really like theatre, take a different elective. He demands participation and class discussions make me fall asleep. Also, he made it mandatory to go see a theatre piece he directed (which you had to pay for). Would not recommend for people looking for a fun elective","Hard Grader.. He demands participation so if you are expecting to relax in this class, forget about it. It is true that it is interesting and he makes the class fun, but it is definetly not an easy A. Loads of work and group work, won't recommend it if you dont like theater or are just willing to fill the humanities req.","Jonathan is super nice but you really need to think of something intelligent to say. If you say something stupid,then you'll feel embarrassed. Class participation is important! This class is so easy to pass if you show up and participate and study for the midterm and final. He is a really nice, understanding teacher and he is very smart!","Attendance is definitely required. Participation is definitely required. And you better read the assignments. The good news is he makes discussions interesting and you actually want to read the books he assigns. It's a good class.","I love this professor! I have taken both art of theatre and the&soc and enjoyed both immensely. I'm a pharmacy major but it was a nice change of pace from the sciences. He's really passionate about the subject, discussions are thought provoking, and every class was worth going to. Attendance mandatory. Not hard if you actually do some work. Easy A","Ridiculously hard grader. As a pharmacy major, I took this as an arts/humanities elective thinking it would be an easy A. It is far from an easy A. I had much harder classes that I didn't work nearly as hard in that I received an A for, including my core classes, but I worked my butt off for his class and I only got a B+. Ridiculous.","Prof. Carr, I believe, is well aware that 50% of his class is there simply because NU requires an art course. He does his best to make sure that students actually learn something, through the attendance policy and surprisingly difficult exams - as long as you keep up with reading (!) and go to class you will be fine.","Very nice, smart, funny. I never wanted to skip, which is fortunate, b/c attendance is mandatory. Knows so much from personal experience, and explains things clearly. For 101 great to have, whether or not you know anything about theatre. You learn about all kinds and sides of theatre and he lets you share your opinions, rather than dictating them.","He does not only rate on how often a student participates, but also on how effective their comments are. I found this very demeaning because he was very rude when someone did not fully understand something. I felt that his grading system was unjust and he is the reason I am switching out of theater as my major.","Interesting professor, makes a lot of jokes. I enjoyed the discussion based class. My only complaint would be that even he admits that his grading is tough and somewhat subjective. There are barely any graded assignments, so it's hard to tell what he is looking for. Participation is a large part of the grade so if you're shy you might have trouble.","Professor Carr is awesome. He is definitely one of my favorite professors at Northeastern. Attendance is mandatory but he makes class really interesting; it's never boring. He has a great sense of humor and he is always willing to help. I definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to fulfill a requirement or is interested in the theatre.","He's such a nice professor and he always cares about his students.

We will always love and adore him for all the love he has showed us from the little things, like helping us with notetaking, to staying up late in the library to help us study.

I talked to him after class about how I am a little anxious about computer use and math and he slumped down to my level (I'm short) and said \"I will take care of you guys\".","BEST MATH-ISH CLASS, EVER. I am actually very math shy and was extremely nervous about taking statistics this summer, but Jarvis was very understanding and patient with me and my concerns. He really cares about his students and does not give up on them. I would recommend him to everyone.","Professor Chen is the best young professor I've ever had at Northeastern. He is energetic, helpful, fun, charismatic, and overall a joy to have in front of the classroom. Take him while you are able to because he will be leaving Northeastern after he finishes his PhD","Jarvis is actually more challenging than he would lead you to believe. He comes off at very laid back, but I know that he actually pushes students more than your typical young professor. He basically made all of his students overhaul their final projects, but made them better for it. He's a very special lecturer and wish him the best in the future","Jarvis is really honest and candid with his students and crystal clear with his lectures. I've never had a more dedicated professor. I missed a week of classes due to a family emergency and he skyped with me over the weekend for two hours to catch me up. Also, he looks so good in his little outfits.

Extremely nice and patient and takes a lot of care and effort to teach his students.","Professor Chen is the best! He loves teaching and he loves his students. He listens well, is really respectful, and really tries to make sure everyone understands the concepts. He even brought donuts to the library when we were all pulling all-nights (SORRY!) to finish his final paper. Just don't skip class. He will forever put you on his bad list","Outstanding professor. He puts an enormous amount of effort into his class. He is easy-going and but makes sure everyone has a good understanding of the material. Hope he'll teach more interesting courses than quantitative techniques in the future.","Goes above and beyond for his students. I've never seen a professor prepare so much or care so much about his kids before. Genuinely wants everyone to do well. He's young, funny, and well-dressed. I hope that he will always love teaching and be as loved as he is this semester.","He's my favorite of all time. Great sense of presentation and has about a billion metaphors for every situation.

Great professor, even greater guy.","Very straightforward transparent style of teaching. Super clear and helpful and tries really hard to teach what some may consider a dry subject (stats). Very entertaining and charismatic. Classes start with a mashup and end with an acoustic cover. HOW COOL IS THAT?Takes attendance VERY seriously, but loses track of time often. Overall, a great guy!","No one else teaches like he does. Very funny, super easy-going, clear as crystal, and extremely patient.

He genuinely wants his students to understand the material and is pretty lenient with grading. That said, the lectures do leave something to be desired.","What a waste!","I will not take his class again. Not helpful. Exams and Homework are harder than he teach in the class. Did not have any examples for the materials. He wants to prove that he knows a lot, so he gets deeper in the materials; however, it is confusing all the time. Even he gets confused by his own materials. Do not have formula sheets for Exams.","Do you plan on taking Econometrics in the future?? If yes, then don't take stats with him. It'll screw your basics and then you'll fail econometrics too. Its not just one course grade that'll suffer.

He also seems really nice and I haven't noticed any rudeness to students. He does not kick people out for being 5mins late. Or maybe not anymore.","He is really annoying when it comes to discipline. It feels like I am back in high school. Like the other people said, he kicks people out if you are 5 minutes late. He wont accept assignments 5 minutes after class starts. He doesn't like when people leave to the bathroom. He teaches sort of well but the class can get really boring.","Class was not too difficult, but his teaching is drawn out and inefficient.

He wants the class to participate, and for those who see college as an extension of high school I would not advise taking this course.

There are quizzes every other week and while the multiple choice is straightforward if you study, she has a tendency to take off lots of points on the short answer. I liked that she doesn't make you memorize bio, but makes you understand it. Get ready to read articles!","I love the way that she teaches. In cell/molecular bio, she didn't make us memorize everything, like most bio classes, but accented the ideas and what they mean in biology. For the most part, I am glad that I took her class, but I feel that the final exam was not even close to being representative of the course; it was a real (grade) let down.","She's a tough professor and grader, but also very fair. You don't get a grade in this class, you earn it. She forces you to think like a scientist. I would definitely recommend her if you really want to learn something. She's a great professor. But if you want a free A take someone else.","i really wasn't looking forward to fulfilling my science requirement, but professor begley made class worth going to. she's very enthusiastic and active in her field, both in research and community service, which made me truly admire her. the class itself is cake as long as you can make connections between class and your service learning site.","the best professor i've had a NU. she's really enthusiastic and passionate about the subject. lectures are always interesting and fun. i almost never used the text, everything you need to know is in the powerpoint lectures. you absolutely must keep up with the work- there's a huge amount of material covered in the course. but it's worth it.","Begley is a GREAT teacher!

Sometimes pulls out obscure material on tests, but all has been convered in class.","Biochemistry is a class that is catered to biology majors. It is created to nurse them through the kinetics and basic organic chemistry.

It is true that biochem is hard and it can make your head spin BUT as long as you keep up with the readings, attend lectures and appreciate Dr. Begleys occasional hokiness you will definitely learn a lot and even enjoy this course.","I've had 2 classes with Begley and done research with her. She is hands-down the best prof at NU. She clearly loves what she does, and you don't feel like an idiot asking questions. She is a brilliant scientist who can communicate at the undergrad level, making hard concepts seem easy.

She's done a lot of really interesting research in the field that was fascinating to learn about.","Challenging, interesting class. English is not her first language, but she most DEFINITELY is a fluent English speaker, and an intelligent one at that. Attendance is essential to understanding the material. She is clearly passionate about linguistics, and wants to help students understand the subject. Power points are clear cut and simple.","It is ironic that she teaches a language class without the ability to convey her materials clearly in a universal language. Power points are super messed up.....","Loved her","English skills are absolutely not good enough to each a class in English, let alone about complex ideas in the english language. Cannot understand questions, so she cannot answer questions with relevant answers.  VERY Frustrating. Expect a challenge. (I wish someone could just sit in for one class to assess her ability, not worth the money)","Dr. Berent could improve her lecture skills, as she sped talks in her lectures. She often \"taught to\" the exams and as such, was unable to foster real learning. The course content drastically varied, and the grading was too test-oriented. Suggestion: a legit written component, instead of unhelpful BB homework, such as writing a paper.","She's really not as bad as people think. If you show up to class and pay attention you'll be fine. Her powerpoints are very descriptive, but you won't understand what's going on in them without actually going to class and listening. If you want to be lazy and not go to class, don't take this class. If you don't go, you'll be lost.

I had maybe 10 pages of notes for a whole semester and half of them were my own thoughts from the cases for that class, it was infuriating","Eval=Excellent.  Rumor was had it that she was an easy grader...not true.  Several friend received unpleasant feedback.  She could do better with reigning in wayward commentary.  Felt more prepared for her exam than any other, great review sessions.  Learned more about the law than in any other class.  Extremely bright.","Course eval=outstanding. Not an easy grader though! Several friends got slammed. Does not spoon feed and makes students think. When law is ambiguous, leaves it up in the air. That’s great b/c it leaves room for arguing both sides on exam. Also, review sessions are outstanding.  Prof. B. truly shines during office hours.","Could benefit from cutting people off and managing the class better.

There's one big test (easy if you take notes), two writing assignments and a rough draft and final paper. Gained valuable research skills through the work.","She is very effective. Yet, she is challenging. However, you'll leave the class as a better writer. My ONLY complaint was her grading of grammar. I have an English prof as a friend, and he helped me correct a paper. When I got the paper back, she still wrote I needed grammar work. It got frustrating. Otherwise, it is a great class.","Fairly good, sometimes boring, grading is very subjective","Britt is an excellent professor. She's intelligent, knowledgable, approachable, and on top of her game. She's a tough grader, but she will help you get the A. Listen to all of her suggestions, and your writing will improve 10 fold. She's not a lawyer, but she does have her Ph.D. Anything she doesn't know, she will look up and have the next day.

His concepts are hard to understand though. He is more than willing you help anyone that asks for it. I think going to class is very helpful because he explains all the concepts, although a little confusing.

Definitely take really good notes, and do the assigned reading. Exams and paper topics are very straightforward.","He was often impossible to understand.

His lectures can be really interesting, if you are up on current events and can see the relation to theory. He makes connections to things that are really unique. Def take his class if you can. I also thought he was an easy grader","Prof. Brown is probably one of the coolest people in the department. He's brilliant on top of it, so it makes some of what he teaches difficult to grasp, but he's more than willing to meet with students and clarify. He reminds me of someone's genius, misunderstood uncle who has a heart of gold.

He is actually the only professor ive ever visited outside of class, and we talked for almost an hour. Nicest guy. The class is easy and if youre up for some one-way high-powered Bush-bashing, I highly recommend him.","He is a nice guy and tries to be very helpful.  His lectures are difficult to understand and he uses essays as his tests.  Proceed with caution, unless had him before.","Prof. Brown is a good guy. The content of his class can be difficult to manage, but if you talk to him outside of class he is always willing to help- you are better off if you do talk to him. Lectures can be a little hard to take notes for, but try to listen.","He is extremely intelligent, yet boring.  He is the epitome of a college professor. He is a liberal, but I didn't see it as taking away from the substance of the class. He's been to law school, has his doctorate. You might say he's too smart for his own good, but his thought process amazes me daily.","This guy should be a spokesman for worst professors ever.

He's supportive of students and easy to talk to, though he doesn't seem to be the most approachable from the get-go. Really awesome prof","Professor Burds's biggest downfall is that his knowledge of and interest in the subject is so deep that he tends to just talk at you for almost two hours, and it's hard to pay attention for that long. That said, his class is my favorite thus far, and most of the material is interesting and original. It'll spark your interest in history, I promise!","Professor Burds is a really interesting and entertaining lecturer. His History of Espionage class is fascinating and although there was a lot of reading material, it was all very interesting to read. In addition, he is VERY generous in giving \"hints\" for all of the tests and if you put the time in there is no reason you should not get an A grade.","Best Prof Ever! Burds comes well-prepared for lectures, power points and texts which are shared on line. He is a passionate lecturer, and I found myself discovering new ways to understand history. I loved this course!","There is a ton of reading that you need to know to do well on his tests. Best strategy I found was to make notes as I read. He gave extra credit papers to students who asked for them. He takes attendance, and not signing in will lose you points. Do not take this class if you're looking for an easy elective. It is a huge time commitment.","Favorite professor at NEU. An incredibly knowledgable and very unique professor  who will treat you as an equal with quality work. If you love the subject like he does, he will know. Good work and effort will get him as interested as you  maybe drinking in Moscow. Also one of the few classes were passive recruitment was possibly taking place.","Massive class, but attendance was sign in sheet.  Class was very long, but Professor Burds(in black blazer,pants,boots) was intelligence and engaging. Class covered by downloadable powerpoint, the content was interesting and his stories were unforgettable. One big exam and paper. If you impressive him, opportunities are unique ... and he is nice.","He lectures at length with his sociology and archival research background. He calls all his lectures discussions but they are just him talking at you and you having to say how a reading almost identical to the last was so 'disturbing' or 'interesting.' He is knowledgable, but he has a limited view of history and can't teach in an engaging way.","Most knowledgeable teacher I've ever had. Quick to be condescending. Very unclear about assignments. He'll have nightly readings for up to 100 pages occasionally, but you don't really have to do them unless he tells you a quiz is coming up. Had to do about 35 pages of writing over the semester. Would not recommend if you want an easy history class.","He is sooooooo smart and knows everything there is to know about Soviet History and much more. Heavy on the reading and pretty tough on his grading, but it's totally worth it just hear him talk. His classes attract a lot of guys interested in spies and secret police. Not a ton of discussion, but he will ask a few questions so be ready.","Best professor I had at NU. Brilliant. Fascinating. Burds really knows his stuff. Reading can be heavy sometimes but Burds gives hints to contents of quiz questions in advance--which really helps. I also loved that this course attracts a lot of former military, and students from all over the world. So discussions are loaded with original insights.","Way too serious about attendance. Not a very nice man. However, knows TONS about the subject. Could've been an interesting class but he had to OVERstuff it with information.","This guy was tough, VERY tough. His lectures go by incredibly fast, and his powerpoints dont have much info on them so you really need to be paying attention. With that said, if you didn't do the readings, the lectures are impossible to follow. He is definitely knowledgeable and knows his stuff, and also expects you to also.","Best Professor I've had at NU.  Extremely intelligent, and more than willing to go the extra mile to help a student succeed.  Tons of reading, but everything is interesting and relevant to the course.  He acknowledges students that attend, participate, and put an effort in.  Definitely someone you would want to write a letter of recommendation.","He's obviously very intelligent and knows what he is talking about. But, this class was one of the hardest I've ever taken. It's definitely interesting and it was worth it to learn some cool information, but it's a ton of work. Do not take this class if you're looking for an easy elective. A lot of reading, note-taking, and studying required.","He is awesome. He's very experienced and knows a ton. Be prepared to sit through very long lectures and get pounded with information from start to finish. There is a lot of outside reading and movies to watch, but as long as you have a general understanding of the material and his listen to the lectures then you will be fine.","Be expected to do TONS of reading and to write challenging papers.  That said, Burds is one of the most memorable teachers I had at Northeastern.  He is clearly an EXPERT in his field and you will learn some really interesting stuff in his class.  He is intense, but if you work hard he will really help you.  Heavy workload but great subject matter!","Don't take the class if you suck at history, I'm learning that the hard way.  Taking a Summer 1 class and it is jam-packed.  He talks really fast in class so it's hard to take thorough notes, but posts his powerpoints online and definitely knows his stuff.  A LOT of reading and outside work, very very easy to fall behind.  May or may not pass this.","Awesome if you're bad at history; he doesn't make you memorize dates&etc. Quizzes are on books so you know generally what to study. He lets you write papers to make up for bad grades on quizzes.

I couldn't stay awake in the class, and the professor stretches out about 15 min of material for the full class time.","I saw some people mentioning her strong accent, but it's really not a big deal. She's very nice and really chill. On the rare occasion that people jokingly express being stressed in the class, she'll just calm everybody down. Also, she's really thorough when introducing mathematical concepts.","This is my second class with Professor Bai. I think she has a very specific teaching style which works for some people and not for others. Fortunately, she worked for me really well. She gives many quizzes but they are short and she will tell you exactly what to expect. I think she is a great teacher for some but not for others.","This class was comically easy. If you have a calc requirement, definitely take Rekha. There's no reason you shouldn't get an A in this class.","Rekha Bai talks in a pretty thick Indian accent, but if you pay attention relatively well and go to class most of the time it is an easy A.

Pay attention, come to class, and if you need it schedule office hours because she doesnt exist on campus otherwise. I suggest read the book if you dont understand then ask in class. She likes questions. She has an accent-meh.","She teaches in a very organized, logical sequence, but does not mind stopping to address questions. She provides time for in class practice and circulates to make sure that everyone can do the work, even if they do not ask for help. She always graded quizzes in a timely fashion and very fairly. She is also flexible, moving the quizzes around.","Ms. Bai was a good teacher, she made everything very clear while she taught.

He is probably the smartest person I've ever met, but doesn't live in an ivory tower.  He's spent summers farming and Spain and just seems to know everything about everything.","Blessington is the best.  Wish he was my grandfather.  He is brilliant, hilarious and nice.  I was doing horribly in the class, probably because I never went during the first half, and he helped me get back on track and completely turn my grade around.  Makes the material interesting and fun, and I would recommend him to anyone.","Best professor I've yet come across. This man is a genius, and it's almost impossible to believe the extent of his knowledge of literature. He has translated Greek plays to English, is avid about Milton, can point you probably to any precise line in Homer or Virgil. Just the best, I want another class with this guy. Smart, funny, memorable for sure","He is brilliant and hilarious. I enjoy listening to what he has to say in lectures. He makes material fun and helps you to understand. I would recommend him to anyone. He's a bit of a hard grader, but it pushes you to work harder. I learned so much from this class.","AMAZING! He has seen and done it all. His knowledge of literature is astounding. His lectures are clear and while he does veer away from the topic at times, his stories/antecdotes are witty and interesting.","The readings were at times overwhelming, and much of the assignments I never finished.  His lectures were amazing, however, and made the class worthwhile.  The man really knows his stuff, and is HILARIOUS.  There are too many Blessington quotes to count.. and too many aren't acceptable for younger readers to see! ;)","Definitely intense reading, I would recommend keeping up with it. Other than that he is extremely knowledgable and impassioned about the subject.","The reading is INTENSE.  I'm an English major and I had difficulty keeping up.  Pay attention to the readings in class - they WILL be on the midterm/final!!!

He makes a few jokes, and has some interesting things to talk about.

He knows his**** inside out and if you ask him a question on what you don't understand, he *will* clarify it and be direct. He's funny too, at random moments. Quite quirky and definitely the biggest character out of all my teachers","professor blessington is very brilliant although can be a bit boring","Blessington is the best professor I have come across at this school. Some how he made paradise lost and a**** load of poetry about god interesting. Extremly intelligent, a fair grader and, he's actully kind of funny. This guy could teach &quot;the evolution and science of tax reform policies&quot; and somehow make it captivating","One of the most intelligent people you will ever have the good fortune to meet in your life.  Honestly, such a great professor. His comments  anecdotes are also quite funny at times.  Although he might as well be the most knowledgeable professor at NU, he doesnt seem conceited.  Good Guy.","This guy has so much knowledge over such a variety of literature, it's unbelievable. One of the few professors I really feel I learned something from. A bit tough sometimes, but stick with it and you'll do fine.","He is obviously very intelligent, but the class was BORING.  Lectures very dry, I wanted to sleep through all of them...

He was hilarious and a great teacher. I learned a lot in his classes!","He is hard to understand, and he tries to be funny, but fails to make sense.  He yells at the class constantly wasting a lot of time.  You cannot bring food or drinks to class.  Unless you suck up to him, you will have to basically teach yourself.","Rude and pompus. His lectures are incredibly fast and will insult you if you answer his questions wrong. I've visited him in his office hours a few times now and each time he has been short and unsupportive. He's a jerk. His teaching ability is standard.","Overall a good professor. Lectures are interesting and he goes on several humerous tangents about his personal life. Teaches at 100 mph, but very clear and concise. His tests are very difficult, but if you go see him he usually provides you with some valuable insight.  Likes to see students who make an effort and care about the class","This guy reminded me that NU doesn't care who they hire as long as he is an MIT grad. Really, he is pompus and arrogant and I gained little understanding from him. His test was questionable at best. On a plus note- I aced the class.

But, she is very fair and willing to help. No textbook but need to do the reading.","I'm sure she would be an excellent professor in a classroom. However, taking an online class with her is very frustrating. Her instructions are unclear and every assignment requires consulting at least two documents to figure out what to do.

She is a nice person, but not a great teacher.","She is AWESOME ! I loved all the help she provided, I definitely suggest taking her class if you can.

I got crazy for this course at the beginning. It was hard for me to catch uo with him. And also ,like most people said, he may not usually tell you what is good and what you should do etc. H e prefer to let you think by yourself more. I can felt that he had definitely helped me improve my ways of thinking.","Had him for college writing. I hated him at first because he is a difficult grader and requires a lot of work, but he is a great teacher. I learned a ton, and I put in the work to get a good grade.","Not a class for the lazy. I hated the hard work at first, but grew to really love and commit myself to the projects. The class is a student workshop, I hate seeing people get upset that he's not doing the work for you. It's college. Grow up and put a little effort/thought into your work. Great Guy, always available for help/questions.","When he talks about the course matter, he's very ambiguous with words! Will never tell you straightforward what to do and what Not to do, juggles a lot with words and mostly bs-ing!! Attendance is &quot;Extremely Mandatory&quot; in this class and even though it's 10% of the grade he won't stop at failing you for that. Horrible Teacher, HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED!!","Took the class a year back. Definitely worked for my grade. My writing improved drastically thanks to his class. Not for the lazy by any means. He genuinely wants students writing to get better. You just have to think outside the box for his assignments. Don't be afraid to experiment. I did not pay for NEU to watch monster movies in an Eng. class.","One of my favorite teachers. Noonan's class is hard, but he's always willing to help you as much as you need. And trust me, you will use the tools you learn in his class in real life.","Extraordinary amounts of work. Yes, practice makes perfect but this is way beyond the limit.","Professor Noonan is a great teacher- I took his AWD class which I was hestitant about taking, but he turned out to be a great professor, and the class was fun!","I love Noonan!!  I was so nervous about being in his class but we only have class 2 out of the 3 days we're supposed to and he usually lets us leave way early.  He's super nice and really wants to help you do well and explore your major and interests.  Awesome professor.","Amazing teacher! This classes really helped me define which area of my discipline I want to pursue. The class is a lot of work, but it's worth it in the end - TRUST ME. He's a really cool guy who's approachable and friendly. If your work ethic meets his expectations, you'll have no problem. The reviews before this are misleading, don't listen.","I had this guy a couple years back..at the time I thought life couldn't get any harder with his ridiculous papers but in all honesty I have used those papers since, for jobs and for transferring schools. Mr. Noonan is deff. a different style of teaching but I loved it.... Put in effort and he is the man and it will reflect in your grade! I miss him","Despite the class being hard as balls, he is the absolute man! and I love his bow ties and he is classy for not wearing a clip on, he ties that sh*t everytime he wears it. Keep it up Mr. Noonan, dont listen to the other D-Bags on this list.","this guys pretty much the hardest teacher I've ever worked with, and I'll tell you why: he's not teacher material.

Her lectures and Powerpoints are super clear and I felt like I really learned in her calss. If you go to class, take notes, and study reasonably for the tests, you will do well.

He treats students with the same respect that the student give to him, very much like a real world boss. go to him with specific questions and he wont let you leave his office until you 100% understand. BNS/psych: TAKE HIS CLASSES!!","The tests are not very fair. He sometimes writes questions that are clearly not covered in the slides. Also, he rounds down: if you have a 89.7 on a test, that becomes a 89. It makes a difference in the final grade.","Each lecture throws a lot of information at you, but it is presented clearly. There is a lot to learn, but Professor Melloni will answer your questions. The tests are pretty tough, you definitely have to study, but it is nothing he hasn't covered in lecture. The PowerPoints are comprehensive and the lecture notes are essential.","VERY difficult class. Dr. Melloni is not available for help, and not interested. He goes over an INSANE amount of material, and doesn't have much patience for questions. No book; material is entirely based off his PowerPoints. 3 tests per semester, and he drops the lowest score, so each of the two remaining tests  50% of your grade. NEVER AGAIN!!!","Really interesting and engaging lectures. He's super smart. Tests are straight forward, all materials from the slides. Provides slides with great notes. Fun class.","Your entire grade is based off 3 exams, but then he drops the lowest grade so it's really 2 EXAMS... 50% each. That's just insane. I feel bad for all the other people like me who get test anxiety and don't perform well that way. Hardest class, but coolest material. Fascinating! I suggest getting a tutor... don't expect ANY help from him at ALL.","Amazing professor and a great guy. Fascinating material. He always made the extra effort to answer someone's question and made sure the class understood. His tests were straightforward.","Great teacher! Really enthusiastic and knowledgeable. He really gets the class involved and tries to make lectures engaging. He doesn't use a textbook and everything from the slides are on the tests. I would highly recommend him!","Loved the class. Interesting material. Easy tests. Eliminates questions no one gets right. No book. Explains everything in depth. I would take another class with him in a second.","LOVED THIS CLASS! If anyone is really interested in the biology part of psychology take this class. Professor Melloni is an amazing professor and makes the class extremely interesting. HIGHLY recommend this class.","He is a great professor! He doesn't use a textbook, so you have to go to class to get the notes. He makes his powerpoints available online so you can print them out. He answers all questions very clearly and makes sure that people are understanding the material as class goes on. He lets you out early most of the time, too! :)","Very interesting class although the first sections can be boring. One thing I found is that although this class is HUGE at 200+ students, Melloni manages it very well and engages the entire class with a conversation-style lecture. Exams could be a bit tough but are manageable and he's very helpful if you need any sort of clarification.","Great class, the information is interesting and Melloni is engaging when he teachers, made me want to go to class. He clearly knows what he's talking about.  Highly recommend!","Easy class. I skipped most of the lectures and did very well. You just need to memorize the slides he asks you to print out. Don't ask dumb questions. He's also very hard to get a hold of so if you have a question ask him after class.","He is very passionate about what he teaches and definitely knows his stuff. There's no textbook, so you need to show up to class. I tend to fall asleep when he goes off on a tangent because someone asked irrelevant questions, but the information is very interesting, so it's great most of the time.","One of my favorite classes at Northeastern! Professor Melloni knows just about everything about Psychobiology but he can be a little condesending if you ask stupid questions, don't come to class, or aren't paying attention. I loved his teaching style, no textbook and the students print out his slides to bring to class and take notes on.","Really interesting class. It's straight forward and pure memorization. I loved having no text book. Melloni knows a lot about neuroscience and makes it very evident. He's a good guy, I envy his knowledge. Memorize the slides and the exams will be a breeze.","He's an awesome, funny guy and he's on top of his game. He's a BIG **** if you seek help outside of class, or ask dumb questions. Essentially if you do your part, he'll do his. Don't look for an easy way out. The class is a joke if you're a BNS student. The exams are legitimately right from the slides.","Dr. Melloni is amazing. The class is really interesting, exams are a little challenging, but if you average a 94 on the first 2, you can skip the final. He is super ridiculously smart - pretty much knows everything about everything, except what happens when you eat a jalapeno..hah. There's no textbook, class only meets 2x a week, and fun lectures!","Really enjoyed going to this class and found it very interesting.  Its not the easiest class, but its worth it.  My piece of advice would be to go online and by the text book that the class is based on, it costs $2 and explains everything with color pictures."],"courses":["PSYCH4510","PSYC4510","PSYC4510","PSYC3458","PSYC4510","PSYC3458","3458","PSYC3458","PSYC3458","PSYC3458","PSYC345801","PSYC3458","PSYC3458","PSYCH3458","PSYC3458","PSBIOUNDE","PSYU458","PSYU458","PSYU458","PSYBIO"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWFUL","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"name":"Melodia, Tommaso","id":"001793665","phone":"6173734159","email":"t.melodia@northeastern.edu","primaryappointment":"Associate Professor","primarydepartment":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","firstName":"Tommaso","lastname":"Melodia","rmp":{}},{"name":"Meloni, Seema","id":"000958745","email":"s.meloni@northeastern.edu","primaryappointment":"Lecturer","primarydepartment":"College of Professional Studies","firstName":"Seema","lastname":"Meloni","rmp":{}},{"name":"Meltsner, Michael","id":"000148230","phone":"6173733218","email":"m.meltsner@northeastern.edu","primaryappointment":"Matthews Dist Univ Professor","primarydepartment":"School Of Law-Academic","firstName":"Michael","lastname":"Meltsner","rmp":{}},{"name":"Menon, Latika","id":"000957973","phone":"6173734530","email":"l.menon@northeastern.edu","primaryappointment":"Associate Professor","primarydepartment":"Physics","firstName":"Latika","lastname":"Menon","rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=745812","fname":"Latika","lname":"Menon","quality":"3.0","easiness":"2.4","help":"2.4","clarity":"2.4","topTag":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK (2)","grade":"2.4","university":"Northeastern University","chili":"cold","tags":["LOTS OF HOMEWORK","TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["PAINFUL LECTURES.

She also stands right in front of the board and always talks into the board when she is teaching so you cannot see what she is writing until she is 5 steps ahead.","Class is incredibly easy, review before quizzes and equations on the board almost makes going to class pointless.  Her lectures repetitive, sometimes incomprehensible, and confusing.  This year her midterm and final along with a few quizzes were not her own tests.  This makes them all insanely hard.  I'd like to thank her for a lost scholarship","Horrible Prof! She doesn't teach she just speeds through a quick explanation of a formula and then does problems.  The quizzes are easy because she goes over problems like the quiz problems right before it.  But BEWARE the midterm and final are not made by her so they are much harder! and the easiness of the class doesnt prepare you at all for them","Munchkin.

I have never been so bored in a class in all of my life. All that he does is go over what the readings said in class- don't expect to expand on concepts. He has a habit of drawing conclusions seemingly out of nowhere, and then getting everyone more confused when he tries to explain.","Guy is an amazing lecturer, but they can run dry sometimes. All he does is go over the readings so going to class is super helpful.","Readings are dense and in order to do well on tests and essays, each reading must be thuroughly analyzed. Meyers is an absolute genius. He can be very boring at times, but is without a doubt an incredibly intelligent and competent philosopher in his own right. Difficult class overall, and Meyers is a fair but tough grader. You will think a lot.","Meyer is seriously the most intelligent man I have ever met. Going to class is so important because he goes over all of the difficult points from the readings (which are difficult!) which will be what you are tested on. Lots of reading, writing, and thinking. Dull class, brilliant professor - he'll make you think.","Meyer is more focused on not cheating the hard-working, motivated students than coddling those who don't care or don't try. He is a great prof if you are in the first group like me. I love the guy. Very serious in class, he is helpful and friendly if you approach him in his office.","Super easy. Classes are boring, but thats mostly because I hated the subject. He kept it more interesting than it could have been. Tests are fair, but tough. He's very reasonable too.","Most intelligent man I've ever met.","Professor Meyer is a genius and if you want to learn something, you have to do your part and pay attention in class, do your readings, and make sure to go the extra mile. Anyone who has anything negative to say about his class are people who didn't do the readings and failed. He's willing to give a ton of extra help during office hours. He's  great","You have to be interested in Philosophy to succeed. Not that Meyer is biased, more so you have to want to work in order to keep up. Requires a LOT of reading and writing. Essays and tests are 100% dependent on the reading. I also appreciated how he was unbiased on all topics and as long as you were rational, he let you write about what you thought.","Review from philo major: The key in Meyer's classes is to pay attention and do the readings. That's what should be expected in any philosophy class, even intro classes. Meyer has nothing against opinions, but prefers rational, unbiased arguments in class. If you show effort in class, he will give you the time of day. Very straight-forward prof.","By far, Meyer was the worst professor I've had. I've never regretted any of my actions in life until now. His lectures are basically just monologues. The paper topics are uninteresting and vague. I'd enjoy the reading if there were stimulating class discussions. If you're a masochist, then you should take this class.","I can tell that he's a great prof. for higher level philosophy, but for a 101 class he's just boring and a bit confusing. He takes a while to get used to. Don't take him unless you're excited about philosophy and want to try and take the time to really think about your assignments. Also, reading before class does wonders.","I highly respect most professors, so I dislike having to write a review like this. This one is an absolute jerk - rude, inconsiderate, completely useless when asking for extra help outside class. He once told me to &quot;keep feminine **** out of his classroom&quot; when we were talking about abortion. Unacceptable for an educator. Avoid this professor.","This guy is brutal!

He relies on his post docs and graduate students to teach the class and did not at all follow the syllabus(all the dates being incorrect anyway). Data processing software necessary for exam questions was not provided. Course material was provided the day of the exam, etc","Horrible teacher. Frequently condescending to students and does not answer emails readily. Does not answer questions clearly. Would not recommend to anyone.

Great professor for P Chem but the class is by no means a push-over.","Sanjeev made pchem bearable. He was super helpful as he was able to be contacted anytime. The exam's were straight forward, you just need to study you homework and pay attention in class. I actually loathed the thought of pchem, but after his class I become much more interested in the subject. Overall excellent professor; highly recommendable.","Prof Mukerjee is a great professor for PChem. He explained things very well and was always willing to help during office hours or at the students convenience. He was a pretty generous grader if you made the effort to answer the questions.","I definitely recommend him to any students who needs to take PChem1 at NEU.

WAY too much discussion, and we focused narrowly on certain parts of theory without getting an eye for the whole field. He does make a lot of effort to meet with students, and he's an easy grader if you put effort in.","Class discussions mainly consist of him using the phrase &quot;So, in a sense..&quot; and useless group work because 3/4 of the group never end up sharing. He is rude and condescending during individual meetings. His handwriting is always unclear and he gives no helpful feedback on papers or tips on how to improve for next time.","Yes, Mullen has jokes, but the group work was ridiculous.  He essentially didn't teach the class, but required groups to pull together impromtu, weird presentations and then was condescending with his feedback.  He was also very rude during a meeting outside of class, and unclear with his reasoning for paper grades.","I've had Mullen for 2 classes and he has shown different (though both good) styles of teaching.  In a larger class he relied mostly on group work and introductory lectures, which is standard.  In the seminar (HIGHLY recommend you take a seminar you're interested in with Mullen) he really engages and encourages individually.","Mullen is a great guy.  He leads class discussions really well and likes to make sure everyone is engaged.  Since it's a lower level class, he doesn't have it at the top of his priorities, but neither do students.  Make sure you do the readings every day!  He uses them for class discussions and sometimes randomly calls on you.","I took Major Figure: James Joyce with Professor Mullen and this is definitely his forte. He had tons of passion for this subject and I would recommend taking a course with him on Irish Lit.","OK, here's the deal with Mullen. Really, really smart and nice guy HOWEVER, he seems more interested in watching TV than grading. Nice vibe in class-- basically we just talk about poems. Do the reading, take notes, and you'll be fine. He wants you to pass and gives extra credit opportunities throughout course. Oh, he's really funny too.","The only real gripe I had with this class was the amount of group work we had to do. He rarely got to my group which gave us no reason to discuss in the firt place.","Lectures are boring and don't have a point. I emailed him a bunch of times to clarify assignments and whatnot and he would either not answer or his answer wouldn't help. He made us do group work often and it felt like 8th grade English class. Oh yeah and you can't read his handwriting, at all.","Yes, he does miss student appointments but he tries to make up for it by giving you extra time and rescheduling right away when that happens. Plus, he does hold office hours you can attend. Grading is more confusing than it has to be. He tries to make class interesting by having students lead but more instructing would be an improvement.","Mullen is totally condescending, never helpful or available outside of the classroom. I had a meeting scheduled with him, and was waiting outside his office for 45 minutes. He never showed. He never answers emails or phone calls either. All we did was group work- he probably only taught the class about half the time.","Patronising, didn't show up for individual meetings all the time, didn't seem that interested in actually teaching, too much group work, and a group paper at the end of the class.  I felt like he should have taught more of the class on his own rather than making us do it.  Moved due dates back.  Took too long to grade papers and midterm.","He's a good guy and is very easy to get along with. Some of the discussions get confusing and frustrating because there is a specific point that he is trying to make out of students' comments.

He is helpful, friendly, and funny to those who he likes, but he makes humiliating comments and has screamed at those who he doesn't. He doesn't like if you miss class, even if its for a funeral or medical reasons. He turned my love for Arabic into fear of it and the class.","I have had Shakir in Arab Culture and Arabic for three semesters. He is my favorite professor at NEU. He is so knowledgable and really cares about students who have interest in Arabic and Arab Culture. He is not easy though, a very tough grader and participation is a large part of your grade. You have to earn every point in his courses.","He's the best professor I have had so far. If you do not do the homework or study the chapters, it will be tough because he makes sure to ask every student a question from the day's assigned chapter. Study the vocabulary, get the online version for Al-Kitaab and participate in class. He has a great sense of humor and makes learning fun.","Absolutely, without peer, the best teacher I had in my whole educational experience. Shakir has a wonderful and worldly view of both education and culture. He is eager to teach anyone who is ready to learn. A brilliant, friendly intellectual with a great sense of humor, I cannot recommend this man strongly enough to meet my opinion of him.","Shakir is a really excellent professor and is very patient and generous with his time when it comes to his students, even if they're students who are no longer in his class. He goes out of his way to make the class funny and interactive.","If you're interested in taking a foreign language, you definitely want Shakir. Admittedly, there is at least an hour of homework a night but worth it. He makes classes really fun with lots of conversation but you have to be willing to step outside your comfort zone.","Very friendly teacher, explains texts clearly, goes over a lot of power point- shows films,clips. Overall hard class if you don't do readings and pay careful attention","Very good teacher. He's definitely tough, and the work load is a lot (more than any of my other classes), but you really learn the language, and Shakir is actually a very funny guy. He works to keep the class interactive and interesting. Do not take if you're not willing to work hard and do a lot of work, though, because you will fall behind fast.","I hear great things about his Arabic Language class, but as for the Arab culture class: don't waste your time. The projects assigned are longwinded and tedious (much like the lectures themselves), and i rarely ever walked out of class feeling like i learned anything new. It's rather obvious that no one wants to be in this class, including Mustafa.","Nice guy, terrible teacher.  His class would just drag on and on; like others have said, he asks ridiculous questions about the readings and if you haven't done them, be prepared for a very awkward time.  His monotonous tone and draining lecture style were just too much for me: I dropped the class the day of the drop deadline.","This class is the most boring class I have yet to take. The professor is always asking questions that make no sense. He likes the arabic students more and it will be represented in their grades.","i took arabic culture with this professor and he SUCKS no one should ever take this class with him.","Shakir is a great teacher. If you actually want to learn the language, pick him. Once you're done with his class you've great arabic skills. Thus, his class is a little demanding.But he understands if the work is a lot, he will cut it down. If the tests don't consist mainly of A's and B's he'll redo the tests.If you wanna learn arabic, pick Shakir!","Awesome teacher. Really wants to help you learn. Tough class, but it IS Arabic, so thats expected. Need to participate to do well. Shakir is really helpful with anything you need.","really nice guy, cares about the student's success. participate and show effort and you will do well.","My favorite teacher at Northeastern so far.

He's no doubt extremely smart, and willing to help, yet he can be very unclear what he wants. Lots of non-traditional music, and you have to write A LOT on it.

He makes sure everyone is on task by calling on you at least 5 times each class. Be prepared. He will know if you're studying or not. Very informative and there are many fun projects. You will learn a great deal.","This guy is the reason the music tech program exists and the reason that it is in such a sad state.

His textbook is literally his lectures in text format. Watching his videos only helps to a certain extent. Try using tutoring cause his office hours only helps a bit. If you want a challenge take his class.","strict grader, decent lecturer, horrible person. He can lecture on and on but he's a worse teacher than the ones from high school. He's a very strict grader but that's not his worst quality. Acts like everyone should just know what he knows within a second of him explaining an entirely new concept. In any case, keep away from this guy.","He is a condescending jerk and is on a power trip because he wrote the textbook for the course and went to duke. They are convoluted and worthless, pick up another book. He is not helpful at office hours and tries to act like a bro when you really just want a teacher. He caters to kids who already had calculus. Take intensive if never had calc b4","I've never met a more knowledgable math teacher. The man is a freaking calculator, he wrote the textbook that you use in class. Extremely committed to helping his students understand the material.","Had Dave for Differential Equations, and he was by far the best math professor I have ever had.  Great communicator, clear instructor, and very helpful and professional both in class and one on one.","He makes you feel inferior and expects you to know a lot. He knows 1/2 the kids in calc 1 had calc, but 1/2 did not at the same time... he does not take this into account.","Excellent teacher.  Fair grader and tends to give high grades.  Weekly quizzes are really easy, but the exams can be tricky.  It is important to learn the concepts, not specific examples.  He can come across as cocky, but he is a good guy over all and pretty funny too.","Little bit sarcastic at times but a great professor. He teaches the material really well and is a very fair grader. At the end of the course he goes through and individually adjust the grades so you can get a boost if you go to class and he knows who you are.","Expects you to truly understand the material and be able to apply it to anything, quizzes are wicked easy but tests not so much. Walked out of all three tests thinking I did REALLY well and got 56 (mid), 74(mid), and 87 (final). Intimidates you when you ask questions sometimes.","He is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is not an easy grader, but knows the material very well and knows how to teach it. Take with him.","I did not do so well in this course, but really has nothing to do with the professor.  He can come off as extremely arrogant, but go to his office hours and he'll help ya out.  Funny guy, some might find it too sarcastic.  He has easy quizzes (picks exactly from a set of homework problems), labs are not as easy (but only worth 4% overall).","Extremely good professor.  One of the few that can actually teach math within the department.  Is a little arrogant, but will be enjoyable if you are not easily offended.  If you can get him, take his course... you will not regret it.","I found this professor to be very arrogant and not as helpful as other comments would suggest. He at times can interject sarcasm and a bully-ness when asking him questions in class which makes it awkward and makes him less engaging. I didn't doubt he was a smart professor, I'll give him that, but he knew it and was cocky about it.","Multivariable Calculus isn't an easy course.  Massey will do a VERY good job of conveying the material clearly.  His humor is like no other professor I have ever had.  To the class, he may appear extremely arrogant, but if you go to his office hours, you'll find he really wants to help. Quizzes are based on homework problems.  Exams are difficult.","One of the best teachers I have ever had, hands down. Just read the reviews. Even the people that can't stand him, just can't bring themselves to say hes a bad teacher...Because he may be the best that is out there. Smartest person I've ever met.

Some apparently think he is cocky, but he's just not a robot. Who else writes LOL on a student's exam when they grade it&#63; (And for the record it was tasteful, not degrading)","Overall, not a bad prof. However, he is very arrogant.

She is no nonsense but can also be a really funny person during lectures. She definitely cares about her students and wants them all to do well; she never tries to trick us on tests and is always very clear about what information will be on the exams.","You will definitely have to work in her class however as long a you attend lecture, do the homework, knock out a couple of practice problems, and go to office hours and recitations (not as bad as it sounds trust me) Then expect an A in her class. Good luck !","Very good teacher. Really cared about everyone understanding the class.","PROF MATHEWS IS AWESOME! She genuinely wants her students to do well and is very approachable and is always willing to answer questions about the material. As long as you come to class, follow along with her practice problems, and do the textbook hw she assigns, you will do great in the class! Plus, her accent is adorable:)","Not a great professor, she treats students like they are still in high school. Rather than ask about concepts on the test, she prefers to assess how well you memorized her class notes. Overall I would suggest one of the other professors.","Professor Matthews explains everything very easily, and is ready to answer your questions. She is very approachable and nice, which makes questions so much easier. She also tries very hard to relate the material to the real world, so you get to understand why what you're learning is relevant.","Amazing professor. Clearly cares about her students and will essentially tell you exactly what is on the exam in the lecture. Do not let the bad comments scare you; if you notice, none of them reported their grade. Organic chemistry is hard, but if you read and go to the lectures, she will make sure you do well. 100% would recommend to others.","She's pretty awesome. Missing lectures makes things difficult, she goes over almost all of the reactions that will be on the exam. When taking the exam, if you're confused, ASK HER A QUESTION!","She is really kind and nice professor, just Orgo is though.","Professor Mathews was awesome. She delivered the information clearly and made it clear what to study for the test. She makes herself available for extra help and does not try to \"trick\" you on exams. Organic Chem requires studying and understanding the mechanisms. Basically if you STUDY and ATTEND  OFFICE HOURS, an A+ should come easy.","Organic is hard. She's not terribly difficult but she's also not very clear. Rather than test you on what appears to be pretty simple ideas, she'll throw something on the test that you've never seen before. Annoying way to ensure not everyone gets an A since at this point, everyone works hard enough for one.","I learned a lot. Great teacher.","Worst teacher ever. Focuses too much time on seating format on test day. If she just spends as much time on teaching and reviewing as she spends on seating, maybe the students won't fail. Stopped giving us bonus pts and started to deduct pts on exams  if we don't write our name on every page of the exam front and back. Completely unnecessary.","One of the good teachers out there. She listens to each student and also goes out of her way to help explain difficult concepts such as NMR. I was expecting an easier class reading reviews from last semester, but definitely do not think so. Prof. Mathews makes Orgo 2 easy to understand and digest! Make sure to attend class and esp. review sessions.","The classis made pretty easy for you. She doesn't blindside you on the test, either. Just tests on basic concepts in very uncomplicated ways. Doesn't make you memorize mechanisms, either, just predict the product given two reactants. You can either go to her class, or read the textbook, but either way the test is an easy A. Helpful when asked, too.","You think you're better off taking this professor's class because you think she'll be easy? Don't make the same mistake many people made. You're better off taking other professors. Her test does not reflect the materials covered in class. Disorganized and inefficient, yet exams are still hard. Don't expect to get much out of the class.","Had her last and this current semester. Is very disorganized and her ppts utterly useless. In her syllabus it states that her class is optional and is only a supplement to the textbook. Her intro to lectures is to yell at her students for discussing their orgo problems and reiterating the fact that her class is not mandatory. worse teacher ever.","A great professor, very reaching out to all the students. Reviewing the materials every day is crucial as cramming a day before the exam wont gurantee you an A. After all...no matter how easy and reaching out the professor is, the course taught is Organic Chemistry.","A genuinely nice professor. Her tests can be difficult... It is organic chemistry. She is still new here and I believe working on her teaching style. If you spend extra time and put in an effort, Professor Mathews will reciprocate and do her best to help you do well.

I liked him from the start, he set the tone for what the semester was going to be through his seriousness but excitement to go through the material with us. Just work hard and participate and he will definitely give you credit.","I had Mazur as an online professor and I can say he was the worst professor I've had in college. Material was not challenging he was just a poor, unresponsive professor. Refused to meet in person for office hours because this was an online course even though he taught other classes on campus the same semester. Stay away, my friends agree","Nice guy and the homeworks are really helpful since they're exactly like the tests. He's strict with attendance and can be a little tough on grading, but overall it seems like he really cares about his students understanding the material. Really easy to ask questions and for clarification. He always has some funny story to share from his life.","Amazing professor! Go to class and you'll be fine. Extremely helpful and straight to the point. Skimming over the lecture/book the day before class will get you an A. Do some of the practice problems in the book, and make sure you can do the homework packets in your sleep (tests are based of them). Wish I could take him for all my finance classes.","Hes a great professor and really  knows the subject well. He is great if you need help or ask questions. I took this is class in summer and while it was fast paced I learned a lot and didn't  mind the class. He makes finance interesting which is hard. You get points for talking in class so do speak up.","Actually the worst professor I have had the displeasure of having at Northeastern.  If you havent taken other finance courses before, stay away.  Be prepared to teach yourself, as he is an idiot.  He will penalize you if you are a minute late, and will call you out in front of the class.  He wants you to respect him, but he does not respect you,RUN","One of the worst professor of Northeastern.","Not the best teacher - very time consuming course with Aplia in addition to in text problems. Cumulative final exam (17 chps) worth 35% of final grade. Expect to teach yourself through Aplia/reading the text. He does not give real life examples nor does he outline the steps in complex formulas. Needless to say, RUN.","He explains very bad and the exams are tough... choose another professor!!","He is a very difficult professor. It is said that it is easy but It isn't easy at all...","Jack was a great professor. I am a business minor and he illustrated every part of what we needed to learn clearly. He was very enthusiastic and made sure people understood a concept before moving on. He wanted you to do well. Go to class, they are interesting anyway. Really good teacher for finance. I thoroughly enjoyed him and look to take again.","Clearly people have varying opinions about Jack, but I thought he was an amazing teacher who had the perfect mix of fun and work.  He is so enthusiastic and helpful and makes sure that people ask questions and know the material. I suggest you give his class a chance it will be well worth your while.","To the post below, last time I checked, finance was all about calculations...                  If you took Fin. Acct and thought that it was challenging, but manageable, then you should have no problem with finance. Jack is very helpful and gives many real life examples based on his past experiences.  Class is straight forward and exams are easy.","Do NOT take him if you ever consider a more ambitious career in Finance. He has absolutely no substantial knowledge and understanding of the field of Finance. He really shouldn't be teaching at NEU.Classes were spent on 75% calculations while real life useful concepts were completely overlooked. I am embarrassed to have had him as a professor.","The Mazur Show is awesome! Definitely very passionate about the subject, encourages participation, and is always around to help. I highly encourage taking his class; tests are straight forward if you put time into the HW and he teaches well to the test and to current topics, which makes class interesting. Great class","best teacher ever!very helpful n also very hardworking.i learnt a lot in his class.","He's smart and into the subject. If you study hard you can get an A. Make sure you hand everything in on time because he has a 0 tolerance policy with regards to handing in work late.","Professor Mazur is an amazing professor. He knows what he is talking about. Lots of real life examples. Def. take notes in his class, everything he said (because they're gonna be on the Exam). Strict on attendance. HWs are easy. Exams are similar to HW.

Her reading assignments and frequent quiz/tests are redundant. Unfortunately she does not teach you however makes you read instead. In addition her text books are not cohesive.","Professor McCarty was my favorite professor for my first semester at Northeastern. She is super helpful, but you must put in effort and approach her if you need help. She cares about her students, and she's a really great teacher.","She is such a stereotype.

CAN'T believe he gets such rave reviews. AWFUL. I think it's because the class has way more students than it should have","This guy is the man!  His class is enjoyable, and the work is pretty easy.  You have to read an article every week and write a 250 word response, all of which takes about 25 minutes.  You also have to take a 5 minute quiz every week and write a paper at the end of the year.  Good class to take if you need an arts and humanities elective","I had him for Film Music class. This guy is hilarious. He's a really nice and easy teacher.

Be prepared to study everything and memorize every single detail from the ppts and readings. The group tests count for 15% of your grade, but barely bump you up (about 1-2% depending on how well you do).","Teacher know what she's talking about and has very detailed lectures. You need to memorize the littlest details for quizzes and study absolutely everything she gives. Tests are short so each question counts as a huge amount.","To pass the class, you would have to put in a lot of work, such as studying and making sure you pass Top Hat, quizzes on Launchpad, assessment quizzes on blackboard, and Biology Lab. Even though that seems intimidating (and for me it really was), it gave you a chance to raise your grade and quizzes on launch pad were really easy to get 100% on.","Missy cares about her students, and has a group work approach that really worked for me. Her tests are very tough, though. She is very friendly and was there to give specific ideas for changes for our final projects.","Missy is probably one of the best teachers/professors I've ever had and has a great personality. It's obvious she has a genuine passion not only for the material but for teaching. That being said, her exam are difficult and detail oriented. However, she knows this and lets you correct them for 1/2 credit and they exams aren't weighted too heavily.","Missy is friendly and really into teaching the material, but she expects you to put in the time and effort as well. There are lots of really interesting outside reading articles with accompanying worksheets that aren't collected, but can be tested on, and tested specifically. Her exams are hard and require extensive studying, but the class is great","Missy is an incredible professor. She is very, very clear and is always willing to answer questions and go out of her way to make sure things are as clear as possible, and there are plenty of opportunities to do well. However, her exams are very difficult and detail oriented- you have to study extensively in order to do even remotely well.","She feels like an elementary school teacher; really dumbs things down in class, doesn't really know much about what shes talking about however she plays it off like she does. Her tests are ridiculously detail oriented that it is almost unfair. However she is friendly and approachable.","The lectures are essential to go to.  She gives you a ton of information and they are fun to listen to because she has so much personality.  However, her exams are pretty tough so you must be ready to apply your knowledge!","She's a pretty great teacher but you do a lot of little in class projects.  Can sometimes feel like busy work.  Never collects anything.  You can get a lot of points from top hat so showing up to class is worth it","hadn't done bio since 9th grade and it was a steep learning curve in the beginning  and it takes work to get up to speed and stay there but she always encourages office hours and relates the material so its easy to understand. Tests are difficult, kinda detail oriented but you could easily to well if you study. do hw, read articles. 10/10 recommend","She is the best.","She's great! She reminds me of a typical high school teacher, but is as tough as a college professor. If you really participate and actually do the class activities, read the textbook for things you are confused on, and talk to her for further explanations you will surely get an A. I never scored above a 90 on any of her tests and I still got an A.","By far the weirdest biology course I've ever taken. She teaches in a style that's more suited for middle school gym class, favoring activities with markers and construction paper over actual lecture. Didn't learn much, but on the plus side it's an easy A as long as you know what bio is, and you're willing to do silly stuff in lieu of  actual work.","I have taken Missy for two semesters now and I love her! At first I was struggling but she helped me. She is a great professor and most importantly passionate about what she does and teaches. Her class is really interesting because of the way she ties everything to the real world. Need to study a lot for exams because they are difficult.","She is very good at teaching, explaining thoroughly. Tests are difficult but she lets you correct them afterwards for 12 pt per question. She loves what she does and can be quite funny. She is really approachable and happy to give you feedback. I've had her 2 semesters and it has been a pleasure. Definitely recommend for any bio class.","She's really helpful if you go to her office hours and she really wants you to succeed. Going to class isn't mandatory but it really helped for some of the topics we discussed. There's a lot of material but getting an A in her class is far from impossible.","One of the worst professors I've ever had. Unaccommodating to students with mental illnesses. Tells you to post on her \"discussion board\" if you have questions, so if you don't have any questions you lose 10% of your grade. In-class activities are useless - I learned more from skipping class and reading the book. If you can avoid this prof, do it.","Great professor! She is very clear about what is expected of you and a good funny lecturer. She will give you study guides to fill out before the midterms; there will be no surprises.

He truly cares about his students and how well they do throughout the course and even after the course is over. His lectures are very informative and he does a great job of applying statistics to the real world. He is an overall great person and great professor.","BEST professor I've ever had. This is the first review I have ever done on here and I really feel bad that I haven't given him a review yet because he is that amazing. He really cares about his students and will continue too after the course is over. Extremely inspirational humble, and smart. One of the best people I know and others feel the same.","He goes above and beyond for his students, I had a conflict where I couldn't take take an exam because I was out of state trying to secure a co-op, and he let me take the exam a different day (against his policy) because \"he really wanted me to get the job,\" he followed up several times asking if I had gotten it, and he's just a genuine good person","He'll give you all the tools you need to get a good grade and really learn statistics and it's real life applications. The classes are very straight forward and he covers every single topic on the syllabus clearly. You will also use some Excel and learn how to use SPSS. You can make your own cheat sheets and he will be always willing to help you.","Seamus is amazing, one of the easiest and most generous professors I've ever had. Listen to what he says in class and go over the homework, problems on the exam are very easy, he is definitely worth it. 1 group project, participation/attendance and homework matter.","Professor McGovern was my favorite professor throughout grad school. His lectures were clear and he made it easy to learn the material. Most of all he was accessible, patient and respectful of students needs.","Clear and precise. Online lectures were good. Would take his class again.","Took his class in statistics and he was a great professor. If you participate every class, the tests an quiz will be really easy.","Very easy A. Lectures can be long and sometimes boring, but homework is easy (I often did half of it and received a hundred?). Ability to make your own cheat sheets make tests easy as well. He cares about his students success and overall is a great professor. Highly recommend.","I enjoyed everything I learned in his class not only because stats is interesting, but mainly because he is a fantastic professor who makes it interesting. He is my favorite professor I've had in college so far. I have so many amazing things I'd like to say, but not enough space to say it all in. Just take his class and see for yourself!","He is the best professor I had in my fall semester. He designs the class so you learn without focusing so much on the grade because that will come if you follow his instructions. I can truly say that I learned and got a lot of takeaways from his class. Sometimes the lectures are tedious, but it's because he explains the material step by step.","He is really nice guy and cares about his students. He knows what he's talking about. The class is boring and sometimes he uses awkward examples, but he is always looking to help you. Easy class overall, expect homework since it's around 20% of your final grade. Also, TA's homework grading policy is questionable.","The textbook readings aren't too long, but it's important that you go to class. He goes over the readings and clarifies what you need to know. He is a laid-back person so there is no stressful atmosphere in his class. There's weekly homework assignments that take some time, but are beneficial. Overall, I believe he is a good stat professor.","Prof McGovern is willing to help students .","He is a very nice person, you can  get feedback from him very soon. Knowledgeable and knows a lot about Stats. The lectures and homework are long, but tests are easy, the project is also not too hard.","Very helpfulapproachable, speaking to him and participation is a bonus. VERY knowledgable about Statistics. Gives an easy project at the end that can boost your grade. Although lectures and homework are long. Tests are easy, always had grades in the 80s-90s. The class was very applicablehelpful while I was interning this summer.","He's a nice guy and wants to help but his lectures are just boring. The powerpoints are endless and the homework every week takes several hours to complete. Not very helpful, kind of vague when answering questions. Knows a lot about stats but the class is really boring. Tests aren't bad, midterm grades: 82, 95, 98","Really nice guy. He tries to be helpful, but he's a really confusing professor. You basically have to teach yourself when you take stats with him. His tests are pretty easy though and he tells you basically what you need to know to do well.","Lectures were confusing. You have to study on your own.","AVOID at all costs. He's possibly the worst professor I've had NEU. Uses powerpoints, that he didn't even take the time to make.
