          "Examines time-tested and cutting-edge methods for shaping and presenting messages across multimedia platforms to effectively disseminate an organization’s message, change a public conversation, or shift public opinion. Examines case studies in mainstream media, public advocacy, and strategic communications to explore the motivations and methods of the organizations as well as the tools and techniques used. Examines the practice of digital advocacy by exploring and applying pertinent findings from politics, advertising, and behavioral science that are increasingly employed by professionals looking to “micro-target” voters, “convert” customers, or “nudge” the public. One major component of the course is hands-on workshops through which students are offered an opportunity to learn how to leverage the latest digital tools for communicating across social media and online platforms. 4.000 Lecture hours",

          "Introduces basic measurements and data analysis techniques. Offers students an opportunity to become familiar with various types of measurement systems and to set up and perform experiments according to a given procedure. Covers basic measurement methods of rotational frequency; temperature, pressure, and power; and analog-to-digital conversion techniques and data acquisition. Data analysis topics include statistical analysis of data, probability and inherent uncertainty, basic measurement techniques, primary and secondary standards, system response characteristics, and computerized data acquisition methods. Includes experiments in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. Topics include cycle performance, flow discharge coefficient and heat transfer coefficient measurements, and psychometric applications in the air-conditioning field. 4.000 Lecture hours",

          "Introduces the relatively young field of soft matter, which encompasses the physical description of various states of soft materials including liquids, colloids, polymers, foams, gels, granular materials, and a number of biological materials. Soft matter (also known as “soft condensed matter” or “complex fluids”) is less ordered than metals and oxides (hard condensed matter) and is more subject to thermal fluctuations and applied forces. Focuses on critical thinking, problem diagnosis, estimation, statistical analysis, and data-based decision making. Includes many in-class demonstrations from colloidal assembly to emulsion stability to cellular apoptosis. Highlights applications such as industrial processing, life sciences, and environmental remediation. Requires graduate study in related field or permission of instructor. 4.000 Lecture hours",
